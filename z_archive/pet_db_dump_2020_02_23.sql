1	Affenpinscher	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	1	3	4	4	5	Toy	Pinscher	Germany	1600s	\N	The Affenpinscher is square-proportioned, compact and sturdy, with medium bone. This breed is a smaller version of a working terrier, and as such is not a delicate dog. This is an active, tough dog that is agile enough to catch and dispatch rodents. The gait is light, sound, and confident. The Affenpinscher has a monkey-like facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends an air of comic seriousness. The rough coat is about 1 inch long on the body, somewhat longer on the head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. This coat type provided protection from pests and harsh conditions.	The Affenpinscher’s name describes it well: Affen meaning monkey and Pinscher meaning terrier. In France the Affenpinscher is known as the “diablotin moustachu”—moustached little devil, which also aptly describes it! As one of the oldest toy breeds, the Affenpinscher’s origins are obscure. Paintings by the old Dutch Masters from the fifteenth century often included dogs resembling Affenpinschers, but more definite evidence of the breed is absent. Small terriers adept at dispatching rats were abundant in central Europe by the seventeenth century. In Germany, they were used to rid stables and kitchens of rodents. Even smaller versions of these dogs were preferred for lady’s lap dogs, able to protect the home from rodents, warm their mistress’ lap, and amuse the entire household with their antics. This small version eventually became the Affenpinscher, which was later refined by occasional crosses with the Pug, German Pinscher, and German Silky Pinscher. The Affenpinscher in turn became the progenitor of other wire-coated toys, most notably the Brussels Griffon. The breed was most popular in Germany, which can lay claim as its homeland. In 1936 the AKC recognized the Affenpinscher, but World War II slowed any momentum in popularity the breed had gained. Since then, the breed has remained extremely rare even in America and Germany, its comparative strongholds.	The Affenpinscher lives up to its name monkey terrier in both looks and actions. They are terriers at heart, busy, inquisitive, bold, and stubborn, but also love to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. This breed tends to bark and even climb. Unlike most terriers, they are fairly good with other dogs and pets. This little dog is best with a family that likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor.	Although an energetic and active dog, the exercise needs of the Affenpinscher can be met with vigorous indoor games or romps in the yard, or with short walks on leash. The harsh coat needs combing two or three times weekly, plus shaping every three months. Shaping should be handled by a professional groomer.	7	9	10	12
2	Afghan Hound	2	3	3	1	3	3	1	1	2	4	3	3	Sporting	Sighthound	Afghanistan	Ancient times	Baluchi Hound	The Afghan is built along greyhound-like lines, enabling this dog to execute a double-suspension gallop and run down fleet game. The comparatively short back and steep pelvis helped the Afghan to leap great heights and to turn almost in place, essential attributes for coursing in rocky mountainous terrain. The large feet provided better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. The gait shows great elasticity and spring, and the dog moves with head and tail high.	With roots dating to the Egyptian pharaohs, the Afghan Hound is an ancient breed derived from the group of Middle Eastern sighthounds. Despite such illustrious roots, most of the Afghan Hound’s development is the result of their use by nomadic tribes as coursing hounds capable of providing small animal meat for the pot. The dogs often hunted with the aid of falcons, which were trained to swoop at the quarry. Generations of hunting in the harsh mountainous terrain of Afghanistan produced a fast dog that also had a good deal of stamina, but most of all, had incredible leaping ability and nimbleness. The Afghan’s long coat provided protection from the cold climate. These dogs remained isolated for centuries, hidden in the impenetrable Afghanistan Mountains. The first Afghan Hound came to England in the early 1900s; at that time these dogs were called Persian Greyhounds or Barukhzy Hounds. They were a diverse lot so a standard of perfection—modeled on Zardin, a particularly striking dog—that described the more elegant, racy dog of today was created. Popularity grew slowly, with the dog appealing mostly to the glamour set. Popularity in the show ring was faster coming, with the Afghan quickly becoming one of the most competitive and glamorous dogs in the rings. In the 1970s the Afghan became a fad breed with the public, but has since dwindled in popularity.	Despite the glamorous reputation, the Afghan Hound’s heart lies in chasing down game over rugged terrain. While these dogs maintain regal bearings inside, Afghans need a daily chance to stretch their legs in a safe area. At times, they may have a reluctance to come when called. They will chase small animals outside, and will coexist peacefully inside. Though they can be gentle with children, the Afghan may not always be playful and interactive enough with them. Described by some as “catlike,” this breed is independent yet sensitive, and not overly demonstrative. They are reserved with strangers; some can be timid. They have a happy, clownish side.	The Afghan needs daily exertion, either in the form of a long walk followed by a short sprint, or preferably, a chance to run full speed in a safe enclosed area. This dog makes a a great family member, and needs a soft bed and outdoor access. Afghans are naturally thin and bony. The coat requires some commitment, especially when shedding the puppy coat; most adult coats need brushing or combing every two to three days. Weekly bathing helps prevent matting.	50	60	25	27
3	Airedale Terrier	4	3	4	3	1	2	3	4	3	4	3	4	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	Waterside Terrier, Bingley Terrier	The Airedale Terrier is a neat, upstanding, long-legged terrier, not exaggerated in any way. This breed has strong round bone and combines strength and agility. The Airedale has strong jaws and a free gait. The coat is hard, dense, and wiry; it lies straight and close, with some hair crinkling or waving.	Known as the King of Terriers, the Airedale is the tallest terrier. Like many terriers, this breed counts the old English, or Black and Tan, Terrier as one of its primary progenitors. These medium-sized dogs were prized by Yorkshire hunters (and poachers) for hunting a variety of game from water rat to fox. The dogs could also find and retrieve birds. Around the mid 1800s, some of these terriers around the River Aire in South Yorkshire were crossed with Otterhounds in order to improve their hunting ability around water, as well as their scenting ability. The result was a dog adept at otter hunting, originally called the Bingley or Waterside Terrier but recognized as the Airedale Terrier in 1878. Crosses to the Irish and Bull Terriers were made in order to reduce some of the remnants of the Otterhound cross that were now considered less than beautiful. By 1900, the patriarch of the breed, Champion Master Briar, was gaining renown, and his offspring carried on his influence in America. The Airedale’s size and gameness continued to win worldwide fame. This dog’s smart looks and manners won it a place as a police dog and family pet, both roles it still enjoys. After World War I, however, The Airedale’s popularity declined, and today this dog’s reputation is greater than its numbers.	Among the most versatile of terriers, the Airedale is bold, playful, and adventurous and is a lively yet protective companion. This breed is intelligent, but often stubborn and headstrong. Some can be domineering, but most are biddable, reliable, and responsive to their family’s wishes. Airedales make good family pets as long as they get daily mental and physical exercise. They like to be the head dog and may not do well when another dog challenges that position, although usually get along well with smaller dogs.	This is an active breed that needs a chance to get vigorous exercise every day. The Airedale’s needs can be met with a long walk, a strenuous game, or a chance to hunt and romp in a safe area. The wire coat needs combing twice weekly, plus professional grooming every one to two months to layer the texture and color.	55	55	23	23
4	Akbash	2	2	2	3	1	3	2	5	2	3	2	4	Gazehound	Guardian	Turkey	Unknown	\N	A unique combination of Mastiff and gazehound features, the Akbash Dog’s characteristics enable him to perform as a livestock guardian. This all-white, lean, leggy, muscular dog has an alert, regal appearance conveying power, strength and courage with the speed and agility necessary to challenge and chase predators. His wedge-shaped head is adorned with pendant ears and long tail is curled over his back when moving or excited. Like other gazehounds, the Akbash Dog is characterized by his long legs, deep chest and tucked flank; the breed’s Mastiff influence is found in his height, weight, broad head and powerful appearance.	The Akbash Dog is an ancient breed native to western Turkey’s plains and mountains, where he was bred by villagers and shepherds to guard livestock from wolves and other predators. Although the Akbash Dog is the Turkish counterpart to other white guardian breeds native to the northern Mediterranean Basin, he is the only breed to have the distinct combination of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics. In the 1970s, Americans David and Judy Nelson began studying these dogs, importing more than 40 Akbash Dogs to the United States. These imported dogs became the breed’s foundation stock in both the United States and Canada. In 1980, the US Department of Agriculture included Akbash Dogs in the Predator Control Program, in which they successfully performed, and in 1998, the United Kennel Club officially recognized the Akbash Dog as a member of its Guardian Dog Group.	Suitable as both a home companion and guard dog, the Akbash Dog is calm, quiet, independent and steady. He is loyal, gentle and affectionate with his human family, children and other pets. He is naturally alert and suspicious toward strangers and can be territorial toward other dogs. The Akbash Dog is receptive to training and should be properly and frequently socialized and trained from an early age to ensure a well-behaved family dog and guardian.	The Akbash Dog’s medium-length or long white coat, which can have light biscuit- or gray-colored shading around the ears or undercoat, should be brushed weekly to remove dirt and hair that has shed. Occasional bathing and regular teeth cleaning and nail trimming are also among the Akbash Dog’s basic grooming needs. Although his activity level is relatively low, the Akbash Dog is best suited for a home with a large fenced yard to provide him with plenty of room to run when needed.	90	120	28	34
5	Akita	3	3	3	3	1	2	1	4	3	2	5	5	Working	Northern	Japan	Unknown	Akita Inu, Japanese Akita	This is a large and powerful breed, with much substance and heavy bone, and is slightly longer than tall. The Akita’s build reflects its original job of finding big game in deep snow and rugged terrain. This breed’s double coat consists of a dense undercoat and straight, rough, outer coat standing off from the body, about 2 inches or less in length. Such a combination provides ample insulation from water and weather. The gait is brisk and powerful. The Akita is a versatile dog of large spitz type, able to perform as hiking companion and protector.	The Akita is perhaps the most renowned and venerated of the native Japanese breeds. Although it bears a likeness to dogs from ancient Japanese tombs, the modern Akita is the result of a concerted nineteenth century effort to restore seven native Japanese dog breeds. The Akita, largest of these breeds, was restored using many breeds, including indigenous Odate dogs, which were used as the best representatives of native Japanese animals. Over time, Japanese breeders selected against many traits descended from some ancestors, including black mask, pinto pattern, and substantial size; whereas American breeders perpetuated those traits. In 1918, the Akita-inu Hozankai Society of Japan was formed to preserve the original Akita, and in 1931 the Akita was designated as one of Japan’s natural monuments. The most honored Akita of all time was Hachiko, who greeted his master every evening at the train station to accompany him home. When his master died at work one day, Haichiko waited for him, and continued to return and wait for his master every day until he died nine years later on March 8, 1935. Today, a statue and annual ceremony pay homage to Haichiko’s loyalty. The first Akita arrived in America in 1937, when Helen Keller returned from Japan with one. Following World War II, servicemen returned home with Akitas from Japan. The breed’s popularity grew slowly until it received AKC recognition in 1972. Since then, it has steadily gained admirers and continues to grow in popularity. The Akita is now used as a guard and police dog in Japan.	As befitting its spitz-like heritage, the Akita is bold, independent, stubborn, and tenacious. Demonstrative to their family, they are utterly devoted and will protect family members. This dog is reserved with strangers and can be assertive, so should be introduced carefully to new dogs and household pets. They can be domineering. Though not the breed for everyone, in the right hands the Akita is an excellent companion.	The Akita appreciates mental and physical exercise every day. They need the chance to run in a safe area or on leash for a long jog. Given ample exercise and training, this dog can be a quiet and well-mannered house dog. The coat needs brushing about once a week to remove dead hair, much more often when shedding. Akitas tend to be somewhat messy drinkers!	65	115	23	28
6	Alaskan Klee Kai	4	4	4	4	2	1	2	4	4	3	3	3	Spitz	Northern (UKC)	Alaska	1970	\N	With his wedge-shaped head, striking facial mask, prick ears and full tail that curls over the back, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a true reflection of his Northern roots, his spitz-type resemblance a smaller version of the well-known Alaskan Husky.	The Alaskan Klee Kai originated in Alaska in the early 1970s when Linda Spurlin and her family desired a companion-sized version of the Alaskan Husky. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Spurlins carefully chose and bred dogs held to their high standards for appearance and physical and mental soundness, thus creating this rare breed. The Alaskan Klee Kai became available to the public in 1988. Although Spurlin called the breed the Klee Kai, which is an Inuit term meaning “small dog,” it was renamed the Alaskan Klee Kai in 1995 before being officially recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1997.	Similar to other small breeds, the loyal and alert Alaskan Klee Kai is territorial and makes for an exceptional watchdog. He can be aloof and cautious among strangers, but is friendly and affectionate with his human family. Curious, energetic and intelligent, the Alaskan Klee Kai plays nice with children and other dogs, though he may not be suited for a home with pets smaller than him due to his high prey drive.	Despite the Alaskan Klee Kai’s thick double coat that moderately sheds, his grooming needs are fairly minimal. He generally enjoys grooming himself, so beyond regular brushing and occasional bathing, as well as regular teeth brushing, nail trimming and ear cleaning, not much upkeep is needed. However, keep in mind the Alaskan Klee Kai sheds seasonally and may require additional grooming. Highly energetic, active and quick, the Alaskan Klee Kai requires plenty of exercise, such as free play in a fenced yard or leashed walks, to avoid becoming high strung or anxious.	5	22	13	17
7	Alaskan Malamute	3	4	3	5	1	1	4	3	1	3	5	3	Working	Spitz, Northern	Alaska	Ancient times	\N	The Alaskan Malamute is a powerfully built dog of Nordic breed type, developed to haul heavy loads rather than race. This breed is slightly longer than tall, and is heavy boned and compact, designed for strength and endurance. The Malamute’s gait is steady, balanced, and tireless. The coat is thick and double, with a coarse outer coat and dense, wooly, oily undercoat, providing the ultimate in insulation. Although the eyes have a “wolf-like” appearance, the expression is soft.	Like most of the dogs of the spitz family, the Alaskan Malamute evolved in the Arctic regions, shaped by the adverse climatic conditions. The breed’s origin is unknown, but was first described living among the native Inuit people known as the Mahlemuts, who lived along Norton Sound on Alaska’s northwest coast. The word Mahlemut comes from Mahle, an Inuit tribe name, and mut, meaning village. The dogs served as hunting partners for big game, and hauled the heavy loads back home. These dogs were, of necessity, large and strong rather than fast, enabling one dog to do the work of many smaller dogs. They were an essential cog in these people’s lives and were treated almost as one of the family, although they were never pampered as pets. When the first outside explorers came to the region in the 1700s, they were impressed not only by the hardy dog but also by their owners’ obvious attachment to them.With the discovery of gold in 1896, a flood of outsiders came to Alaska; for entertainment, they staged weight-pulling contests and races among their dogs. The native breeds were interbred with each other and those brought by settlers, often in an attempt to create a faster racer or simply supply the vast numbers of dogs needed to supply the gold rush. The pure Malamute was in danger of being lost.	In the 1920s, a New England dog racing enthusiast obtained some good specimens, and began to breed the traditional Malamutes. As the breed’s reputation grew, some were chosen to help Admiral Byrd in his 1933 trek to the South Pole. During World War II, the Malamute was once again called into service, this time to serve as freight haulers, pack animals, and search-and-rescue dogs. In 1935, the breed received AKC recognition and began a new phase as an imposing show dog and loyal pet.	The Alaskan Malamute loves cold weather, and especially loves the snow. They can run for miles and need to have adequate exercise every day, either in the form of a long walk on leash or the opportunity to run. The coat needs brushing once or twice a week, more when shedding.	75	85	23	25
8	American Bulldog	4	4	5	4	3	2	2	5	5	1	1	3	Bully	Guardian (UKC)	England	18th Century	\N	An energetic, active working dog, the American Bulldog exudes a dominant, powerful and athletic appearance, with strong muscles and substantial boning. He is recognized for his strength, courage and working abilities, whether guarding property or driving livestock.	Originating in England, the general bulldog type began as a working dog that drove cattle and guarded his master’s property. Known for his strength, courage and ease around livestock, the breed began being used for bull baiting before it was outlawed in England. Consequently following the ban, the breed was replaced with the less athletic, shorter and stockier English Bulldog.Meanwhile, the original bulldog type was preserved by working class immigrants, who brought them on their journey to America to use as all-around working dogs on farms and ranches in the South. The breed nearly became extinct after World War II, but a returning war veteran named John D. Johnson worked to revive the breed alongside Alan Scott and other breeders. From here came the Johnson and Scott types — the former being the “standard” (a sleek, athletic dog built for performance) and the latter being referred to as the “bully” (a bulkier, heavier dog with more muscle mass). Despite these differences, Johnson and Scott maintained the breed’s overall health and working abilities. Today, the modern American Bulldog as we know it remains a well-rounded working dog, courageous guard dog and faithful family companion. The United Kennel Club recognized the American Bulldog in 1999.	The American Bulldog is an agile, confident and loyal protector for his human family, as well as of personal property. He is a gentle, affectionate and loving companion, albeit fearless and ready to strike should any intruder cross his path. An energetic, active working dog, the American Bulldog exudes a dominant, powerful and athletic appearance, with strong muscles and substantial boning. He gets along well with young children, as well as dogs and other pets so long as he was raised with them from the start. The American Bulldog does not do well when left alone for prolonged periods of time. With proper socialization, training and regular exercise, the American Bulldog is a true companion and excellent watchdog.	Because of his working past, the American Bulldog is quite familiar with being outdoors, but like most dogs, he thrives on living indoors with his owner. As such, he should be frequently exercised with plenty of engaging activity to burn off energy and combat boredom, avoiding consequential destructive behavior. Otherwise, the American Bulldog is a relatively low-maintenance breed, requiring not much else than mopping up his regular drool and slobber and minimal grooming for his short, fine coat.	60	120	20	27
9	American Cocker Spaniel	3	3	4	5	5	5	4	1	4	4	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	United States	1800s	\N	The smallest member of the Sporting Group, the Cocker should be compact and sturdy. Their gait is ground covering, strong, and effortless. The coat is silky, flat or slightly wavy, not overly long. Excessive coat can hinder the dog in the field. The head and expression are hallmarks of the breed; the expression is soft and appealing. The Cocker should still be able to spend a day in the field and should be balanced and athletic. It is true, however, that most Cockers now have too much coat for field work.	The American version of the Cocker Spaniel is derived from the English Cocker Spaniel. In the late 1800s, many English Cockers were brought to America, but American hunters preferred a slightly smaller dog to hunt quail and other small game birds. The American Cocker is smaller, with a rounder head, shorter muzzle, and more profuse coat than its English ancestor. Just how this smaller Cocker was developed is not entirely clear; some credit the dog Obo 2nd, born around 1880, as the first true American Cocker. But other evidence points to crosses of the English Cocker with even smaller toy spaniels (that nonetheless arose from the same ancestral stock).Initially the English and American Cocker Spaniels were considered varieties of the same breed, but they were officially separated by the AKC in 1935. Although Cockers were already popular, after the separation the American Cocker surged in popularity and has remained one of the most popular breeds of all time in America. In fact, it was the most popular breed for many years. So popular was it that it was eventually divided into three color varieties: black, particolor, and ASCOB, which stands for Any Solid Color Other than Black. Only recently has its popularity spread to England, where it was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1968, and it has gained admirers steadily since.	This breed is known as the “merry” Cocker, and the name is most fitting. He is playful, cheerful, amiable, sweet, sensitive, willing to please, and responsive to his family’s wishes. He is not known for retaining his hunting instincts, but he is inquisitive and will appreciate a country outing. He is equally at home in the city and will happily walk on leash for his exercise needs. Some bark a lot; some are overly submissive.	Although he enjoys a romp, the Cocker can receive adequate exercise with a long daily walk on a leash. The coat of the Cocker requires a greater commitment than that of most breeds, although pets can be clipped short. In order to maintain a nice coat, he will need to be brushed and combed two to three times a week, in addition to professional clipping and scissoring every month. Special attention must be paid to ear and eye cleanliness in this breed. The profusely coated feet tend to carry debris. Cockers have a tendency to become overweight.	24	28	14	16
10	American Eskimo Dog	3	3	4	3	2	2	2	4	3	5	5	3	Non-sporting	Spitz	United States	Early 1900s	\N	The Eskie is built along classic Nordic Spitz lines. This breed is compactly built, slightly longer than tall. The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold resistant, and the trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.	As the prototypical spitz, the Eskie (as this breed is often called) is just as often simply called spitz by pet households. In fact, the American Eskimo Dog descended from one of the varieties of spitz developed in Germany, with influences from other spitz breeds such as the Keeshond, Pomeranian, and Volpino Italiano. Ironically, it was the success of these other breeds that held the Eskie back. Although the Keeshond originally came in several colors, when it was decided to accept only gray specimens, the white Keeshonden were suddenly excluded. When the Pomeranian standard was drawn up to exclude dogs over 8 pounds, larger dogs were excluded as Pomeranians. Thus, by the early 1900s, there were two groups of medium-sized white dogs that, although pure-breds, were excluded from their breeds. Their fate is unknown, but it is likely that they became pets of the working people.When European workers came to America, they brought these dogs with them as general farm workers and watchdogs. The UKC began registering them in 1913. In the 1920s the American Spitz (as it had come to be called) became a favorite of circus performers. Spectators often left the circus with a new family member—an offspring of one of the dazzling performers. Many present-day Eskies can be traced back to their circus ancestors.After World War I, the breed’s name was changed to American Eskimos, to remove any Germanic sound from the name. Most Eskies were kept as pets and farm dogs. It wasn’t until 1994 that the AKC recognized the breed. The Eskie remains a dog of the people, and a very popular companion.	The American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively, and fun loving—in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to this dog’s spitz heritage, The Eskie is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. They are among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and are calm and well-mannered inside. Because of their watchdog origins, Eskies can be wary of strangers, and may not be the best choice for homes with small children, other dogs, or pets unless well supervised.	The Eskie is energetic and needs a good workout every day. The extent of the workout depends on the size of the dog, with the larger Eskies needing a good jog or long walk and the smaller Eskies needing only a vigorous game in the yard or short walk. Eskies like cool weather. The double coat needs brushing and combing twice weekly, more often when shedding.	6	40	9	19
11	American Foxhound	4	4	3	3	5	4	4	1	2	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1600s	\N	The American Foxhound is slighter of bone and higher on leg that the English Foxhound, with more rear angulation and arch over the loin. These attributes allow greater speed and agility over rough terrain. The American Foxhound has a melodious voice when on the trail. The coat is hard and of medium length. The expression is gentle and pleading.	This most American of breeds dates back to 1650, with the first record of fox-chasing hounds arriving from England. By the 1700s, riding to the hounds had become extremely popular with the upper class; even George Washington found it a favorite pastime. George Washington crossed descendants of these early foxhounds with French foxhounds the Marquis de Lafayette gave him, and these dogs are behind the American Foxhound. Imports from England, France, and Ireland helped further shape the breed. Foxhound pedigrees have been recorded in America since 1850. Around this same time, the sport spread to the southern United States, particularly the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee, and hunters there preferred a faster dog with the ability to start and chase a fox alone, and also to give chase to deer. The dogs became more streamlined than their English counterparts. The dogs further developed into different strains, the most popular being the Walker. This strain descends from a dog named Tennessee Lead, alleged to have been stolen from a deerchase by a dog trader, who subsequently sold him to George Washington Maupin. His breedings to this fast running foxhound produced some of the best running dogs seen to that time. Dogs from that strain were subsequently called Walker hounds. Other strains of foxhounds include Trigg, Goodman, July, Calhoun, and Hudspeth. These dogs eventually became specialized as either running hounds or show hounds, with the former being even further specialized as competitive field trial hounds and pack hounds. The pack type is generally considered the prototypical Foxhound. These dogs combine great speed, endurance, and jumping ability with a strong nose and willingness to give chase as a pack member. In 1886, the American Foxhound became one of the earliest breeds to be registered by the AKC, although registrations have never been particularly high. The low AKC registration numbers belie the Foxhound’s popularity, however, because most Foxhounds are kept by those with little interest in AKC registration. The Foxhound can thus lay claim to being one of the most unpopular popular breeds in America.	Although by tradition the Foxhound was not a house pet, this dog is well mannered in the home. Foxhounds get along best with human or canine companionship. They are tolerant, amiable, and gentle dogs, even though they are not very demonstrative. Most are reserved with strangers. This dog needs daily exercise in a safe area. Once on a scent, the Foxhound will follow gleefully, heedless of commands. This is a dog that bays and likes the outdoors, and is not usually defined as a city dog.	The Foxhound needs daily exercise, preferably in the form of a long walk or jog. If allowed to run off leash, this breed should only be in a safe enclosed area. The coat is easily maintained, requiring only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	40	65	21	25
12	American Hairless Terrier	2	2	3	3	4	4	3	2	4	2	5	2	Terrier	Terrier	United States	1970s	\N	The American Hairless Terrier is a small, well-muscled and active terrier that can either be of the hairless or coated variety. Although the breed’s ancestors hunted rodents, the American Hairless Terrier is unsuited for hunting due to his lack of coat on the hairless variety. His keen hunting instinct, however, remains intact.	The only hairless breed indigenous to the United States, the American Hairless Terrier was developed by breeder Edwin Scott in the 1970s in Louisiana as a descendant from the Rat Terrier. Scott bought a hairless puppy named “Josephine” from a litter of otherwise all-coated Rat Terriers. Josephine was bred and produced a hairless female called “Gypsy.” From there, Josephine went on to produce several litters of coated pups before producing hairless siblings “Jemima” and “Snoopy.” After Snoopy sired several litters of hairless offspring, a new breed was established. The American Hairless Terrier was accepted by the United Kennel Club in 2004 and by the American Kennel Club in 2016.	The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Like other terriers, the American Hairless Terrier is clever, energetic and intelligent, and relishes in playing, digging and chasing small game. The breed isn’t suitable for hunting due to his lack of coat, yet still has a strong prey drive. Because such, playtime is recommended on leash or in a fenced yard. Alert, inquisitive and active, the American Hairless Terrier gets along well with children, dogs and other pets. He thrives on companionship and affection with his human family. Intelligent, eager to please and readily trainable, the breed is enthusiastic about activities with his owner and does well in agility and obedience competition.	The American Hairless Terrier can be one of two varieties: hairless with whiskers and eyebrows or coated with short, shiny hair. Either is a fine choice for those who suffer from dander allergies, and grooming needs for both types are minimal. Smoothly muscled and active, the American Hairless Terrier requires moderate exercise. Keep in mind the hairless variety warrants protection from the harsh summer and winter weather when outdoors, whether it be sunscreen or protective clothing. Aside from regular teeth brushing, the American Hairless Terrier’s ears should be cleaned often to remove any foreign debris and wax buildup.	12	16	12	16
13	American Staffordshire Terrier	3	3	3	3	1	1	3	5	4	1	3	5	Terrier	Terrier, Mastiff, Bull	United States	1800s	American Pit Bull Terrier	American Staffordshire Terriers are muscular, giving the impression not only of great strength for their size but also of grace and agility. Their gait is springy. Their low center of gravity help them to easily stay on their feet, however they are also quite nimble. The coat is short, close, and glossy.	The American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier descended from the same lines. The fist dog originally sprang from mixing the old type of Bulldog with some old terrier types, probably the English Smooth Terrier. The result was aptly called the Bull and Terrier, later to be dubbed the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. They gained passage to America in the late 1800s, where they became known as the Pit Bull Terrier, American Bull Terrier, and even Yankee Terrier. Americans favored a slightly bigger dog than the English preferred, and with time the two strains diverged.In 1936, the AKC recognized the breed as the Staffordshire Terrier (the name was changed in 1972 to American Staffordshire Terrier). The Am Staff evolved to have a sweet and trustworthy disposition around people. Unfortunately, these dogs have sometimes appealed to people seeking them for their strength rather than their loving abilities. Beginning in the 1980s, Am Staffs sometimes found themselves the target of breed-specific laws aimed at banning or controlling certain types of dogs. Despite this, the Am Staff is extremely popular among people wanting a people- and fun-loving dog.	Typically docile and playful with their family, American Staffordshire Terriers are also generally friendly toward strangers as long as their family is present. They are generally very good with children. They are a protective breed and should be introduced to new dogs carefully. They are stubborn, tenacious, and fearless. For all of their tough persona, the most important thing in life to this breed is their family’s fond attention.	Am Staffs need a daily outlet for their energy, preferably in the form of a long walk on leash or a vigorous game in the yard. Coat care is minimal.	57	67	17	19
14	American Water Spaniel	4	3	4	3	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	United States	1800s	\N	The American Water Spaniel packs a lot of ability into a comparatively small dog. This breed’s muzzle is long and strong enough to carry a large goose, and has strong quarters to propel through water and over land. This dog is slightly longer than tall, solidly built and muscular. The coat can range from uniform waves (marcel) to close curls, with a dense undercoat. This combination provides protection against weather, water, or briars. The ears are well covered with hair, which should not grow into the ear canal. The gait is balanced, with reach and drive.	Exactly when and where, or from what the American Water Spaniel was developed was never recorded. The breed’s appearance strongly suggests a smaller version of the Irish Water Spaniel, and it is likely that this dog is derived from that breed or its earlier versions, the Northern, Southern, and Tweed Water Spaniels. The Curly-Coated Retriever and its forebear, the English Water Spaniel, may also have played a role. Some theories even credit the American Indians who lived in the Great Lakes regions as the creators of the breed.Whatever its origin, the American Water Spaniel first became established as a recognizable breed in the midwestern parts of the United States, where it was unsurpassed as a hunting companion. This small dog, then called the American Brown Spaniel, with the waterproof coat and keen nose could hunt through rough thickets, spring game, and retrieve all manner of game from land and water, often marking several fallen birds before retrieving them all unfailingly.The United Kennel Club recognized the breed as the American Water Spaniel in 1920, but until recognized by the AKC in 1940, no one ever considered breeding these dogs for anything but hunting ability. Even after recognition, the breed’s forte remained in the field, and it is rare today as a pet. Today the American Water Spaniel is among the least known of AKC recognized breeds, despite being one of only two sporting breeds developed in America. In fact, the American Water Spaniel is the State Dog of Wisconsin.	As this breed’s name implies, the American Water Spaniel is a natural lover of water. Not only are they skilled and versatile retrievers, but they are also tractable fun-loving family dogs—as long as they get regular physical and mental exercise. American Water Spaniels are sensitive and willing to please. Some can be timid. Generally good with other dogs in the household, some are assertive and should be introduced carefully to new dogs and household pets. Barking is frequent; some also whine or drool.	The American Water Spaniel needs daily exercise, although this requirement can be met with a long walk. The coat is oily and needs weekly brushing. Hair may be groomed from the feet and topknot. Ears should be checked regularly.	25	45	15	18
15	Anatolian Shepherd	2	3	3	3	1	3	1	5	3	2	3	5	Working	Likestock dog, Mastiff, Flock guard	Turkey	Ancient times	Coban Kopegi, Karabash Dog, Kangal Dog	The Anatolian is built tough to do a tough job. This is a large, powerful, rugged dog, having both great agility and endurance. The Anatolian has good bone and a large head, plus a powerful, smooth, and fluid gait. This breed’s coat consists of a thick undercoat and an outer coat that ranges from short (about 1 inch) to rough (about 4 inches), slightly longer around the neck and mane. The expression is intelligent, and the general impression is one of a bold yet calm protector.	The Anatolian Shepherd is an ancient guardian breed with a long working history. This dog’s roots probably lie in the Tibetan Mastiff and Roman Mollosian war dogs that came to Turkey more than 4,000 years ago. Here they proved invaluable as staunch defenders of livestock against formidable predators, including wolves and bears. They accompanied the nomadic shepherds and became widespread over a large geographical region, accounting for the Anatolian’s great variation in size, coat type, and color. Several traits that remained constant throughout all the breed, however, are loyalty, independence, and hardiness.The name Shepherd is a misnomer because the breed was never used as a herder. This breed’s Turkish name, koban kopegi, means shepherd’s dog. There is disagreement over whether the Anatolian is a separate breed from the Kangal (or Karabash) dog.The first of the breed did not come to America until the 1950s, where although they proved themselves as effective livestock guards against coyotes and other predators, they remained relatively unknown. Only in the late 1970s and 1980s did the Anatolian Shepherd begin to be more widely appreciated, still valued for its utilitarian, rather than cosmetic, attributes. Pet owners desiring a loyal and effective guardian began to acquire the breed. In 1996, the Anatolian Shepherd was accepted in the AKC Working Group, and they continue to have strong working instincts above all else. Anatolians are used for cheetah conservation in Africa by protecting livestock from cheetahs.	This is a serious dog, devoted to his family and duty as family protector. At the same time, Anatolians are laid back and easygoing, never on the lookout for trouble. They are suspicious of strangers and are territorial. While good with children, they may not be playful enough to satisfy children’s desires. As a serious watch dog, this dog tends to bark a lot when his suspicions are aroused.	The Anatolian Shepherd needs a chance to exercise every day, either with a long walk or brisk run, and needs to socialize with his family. Coat care is minimal, consisting only of a weekly brushing to remove dead hair.	80	150	27	29
16	Australian Cattle Dog	5	5	4	4	3	2	2	4	5	2	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Australia	1800s	Queensland Heeler, Blue Heeler, Hall's Heeler, Red Heeler	The Australian Cattle Dog is of moderate build, enabling this breed to combine great endurance with bursts of speed and extreme agility necessary in herding cattle. This dog is sturdy and compact, slightly longer than it is tall. The Australian Cattle Dog’s gait is supple and tireless, and must be capable of quick and sudden movement. The weather-resistant coat consists of a short, dense undercoat and moderately short, straight outer coat of medium texture.	In the early 1800s, vast land areas in Australia became available for grazing cattle. The cattle raised on these lands became so wild and intractable that the traditional European herding breeds that had proved satisfactory on tamer cattle were no longer suited for the job. A dog was needed that could withstand traveling long distances over rough terrain in hot weather and that could control cattle without barking (which only served to make wild cattle wilder).In 1840, a man named Hall bred some smooth blue merle Highland Collies to Dingos, producing a strain known as Hall’s Heelers. One particularly influential dog was named Bentley’s Dog, and is credited with originating the white blaze found on the head of Australian Cattle Dogs today. Other breeders crossed their Hall’s Heelers with other breeds, including the Bull Terrier, Dalmatian, and, later, Black and Tan Kelpie, a sheepherding breed. The result was a dog with the herding instincts of the Collie and Kelpie, the endurance, ruggedness, and quiet style of the Dingo, and the horse sense and protectiveness of the Dalmatian, all with a distinctively patterned coat.As the dogs became increasingly vital to the cattle industry of Queensland, they gained the name Queensland Blue Heeler. They later became known as Australian Heeler, and then Australian Cattle Dog. A standard for the breed, emphasizing the Dingo characteristics, was drawn up in 1897. The Australian Cattle Dog was slow to catch on in America, however, perhaps because the breed bore little resemblance to established herding breeds. When given a chance, they proved their merits and were welcomed as herders and pets. The AKC recognized the breed in 1980.	Smart, hardy, independent, stubborn, tenacious, energetic, and untiring— these are all traits essential to a driver of headstrong cattle, and all traits of the Australian Cattle Dog. Given challenging mental and hard physical exercise daily, this breed is among the most responsive and obedient of dogs. The Cattle Dog tends to nip at heels of running children, but is good with older children.	The Australian Cattle Dog is active and tireless. A good jog or long workout, coupled with obedience lessons or other intellectual challenges, is essential every day; a bored ACD can be destructive. They are happiest when they have a job to perform, and especially when that job is herding. This breed is unsuited for apartment life. The coat needs brushing or combing weekly to remove dead hairs.	35	45	17	20
17	Australian Kelpie	5	5	4	3	3	3	2	3	4	2	2	4	Collie	Herding (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Australia	1800s	Kelpie, Barb	The Australian Kelpie is a lithe, energetic breed with hard muscle tone and effortless mobility, demonstrating his capability for relentless work. He has a knack for working sheep, whether in open fields or closed yards, and is versatile enough to withstand the demanding heat and dry conditions in Australia, where the breed originated.	The Australian Kelpie originated in the late 1800s as a descendant of British and Scottish Collie-type dogs. This active, tireless working breed is known for using his eyes, bark and bite to move livestock in Australia’s harsh conditions, including heat, dust storms, rough terrain and vast distances. The Australian Kelpie’s name came from the breed’s foundation female named “Kelpie.” Today, the Australian Kelpie is imported to the United States and bred by American ranchers and farmers as a working stock dog, as well as a dog to participate in herding trials, obedience and agility.	Alert, intelligent and loyal, the Australian Kelpie is an agile and active dog with boundless energy. He thrives on having a job to do, but also knows when to give it a rest, thanks to his on-and-off switch. Wholly devoted to his work, the Australian Kelpie is keen on working sheep and other livestock, yet his docile, friendly and easygoing temperament also positions him as a suitable house dog. A naturally cautious herding breed, the Australian Kelpie is a good watch dog, provided he receives plenty of socialization and training so that he doesn’t become wary or anyone or anything else.	A relatively low-maintenance breed, the Australian Kelpie has a thick, water-repellant double coat that sheds regularly. The coat should be brushed weekly to remove dead hairs and bathed occasionally. This highly energetic breed requires substantial daily exercise, both in the physical and mental senses. Jogging, walking and free running in a fenced yard are excellent outlets to help him burn energy. Agility, obedience and rally also are other good avenues for physical activity, as well as for keeping this eager-to-please breed mentally sharp.	31	46	17	20
18	Australian Shepherd	4	5	5	4	3	3	2	4	5	3	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	United States	1800s	\N	This is an athletic dog of medium size and bone; The Australian Shepherd is lithe, agile, and slightly longer than it is tall. This breed is muscular and powerful enough to work all day, without sacrificing the speed and agility. This dog’s gait is free and easy, and must be able to change direction or speed instantly. The double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat of medium texture and length, straight to wavy. The expression is keen, intelligent, and eager.	The Australian Shepherd is not really an Australian breed, but came to America by way of Australia. One popular theory of the breed’s origin begins during the 1800s when the Basque people of Europe settled in Australia, bringing with them their sheep and sheepdogs. Shortly thereafter, many of these shepherds relocated to the western United States, with their dogs and sheep. American shepherds naturally dubbed these dogs Australian Shepherds because that was their immediate past residence.The rugged area of Australia and western America placed demands on the herding dogs that they had not faced in Europe, but through various crosses and rigorous selection for working ability, the Basque dog soon adapted and excelled under these harsh conditions. The breed kept a low profile until the 1950s, when they were featured in a popular trick-dog act that performed in rodeos and was featured in film. Many of these dogs, owned by Jay Sisler, can be found in the pedigrees of today’s Aussies.The first Aussie was registered with the International English Shepherd Registry, now known as the National Stock Dog Registry. The AKC recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1993. Its popularity according to AKC statistics underestimates the popularity of this breed because a large proportion of this working breed remains unregistered with the AKC. This dog is among the most versatile of breeds, excelling at conformation, obedience, herding, and agility competition. The Aussie is also adept at working cattle; in fact, some believe its close working style is more suited to cattle than to sheep.	The Australian Shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart, and responsive. If they don’t get a chance to exercise and challenge their strongly developed mental and physical activities, they are apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, this dog is a loyal, utterly devoted, and obedient companion. The Aussie is reserved with strangers, and has a protective nature. This breed may try to herd children and small animals by nipping.	This breed needs a good workout every day, preferably combining both physical and mental challenges. The coat needs brushing or combing one to two times weekly.	40	65	18	23
19	Australian Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	1	2	3	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	Australia	1900s	\N	The Australian Terrier is small, sturdy, and medium boned; this breed is long in proportion to height. This is a working terrier that should exhibit a ground-covering gait and hard condition. This dog’s weatherproof coat is made up of a short, soft undercoat and a harsh, straight, outer coat, about 2.5 inches long, shorter on the tail and lower legs. They sport a ruff around the neck and a topknot of longer hair adds to their keen, intelligent expression.	The national terrier of Australia, this is one of the smallest of the working terriers. This breed was born in Tasmania, from various European breeds, and shares much of its background with the Silky Terrier. In Tasmania, the Rough Coated Terrier was an all-purpose companion, protecting the home and farm from rodents, controlling livestock, and sounding the alarm at intruders. A cornucopia of breeds was crossed with this dog, among them the precursors of the Skye, Dandie Dinmont, Scotch, Yorkshire, and Manchester Terriers. The result was a dog that was both useful and striking in appearance.The first of the breed was shown in the late 1800s as a “broken-coated terrier of blackish blue sheen.” The name was soon changed to the Blue and Tan, the Toy, then the Blue Terrier, then in 1900 the Rough-Coated Terrier, Blue and Tan. Although mainly known for its blue and tan coloration, a red or sandy color was also found among the early representatives of the breed. Soon after the breed had made its way to British show rings and homes, and by 1925 it had come to America. The Australian Terrier received AKC recognition in 1960.	One of the quieter terriers, the Aussie is nonetheless a plucky, tough character, ready to go after a rodent when the chance arises. This dog is fun loving and adventurous, and needs daily exercise to keep from becoming frustrated. Aussies are clever and generally eager to please, making them one of the more obedient terriers. They get along fairly well with other dogs and household pets. They are reserved with strangers. Reflecting their earth dog heritage, they like to dig.	This is an active breed that needs a good outing every day, either a moderate walk, a rollicking game, or an off-lead run in a safe area. Their wire coat needs weekly combing plus twice yearly professional grooming (regular plucking of dead hairs will keep the coat in optimal condition year round). Some trimming around the feet will add to a tidy look.	12	14	10	11
20	Basenji	4	3	3	3	2	1	3	1	2	1	3	5	Hound	Sighthound, Primitive	Central Africa (Zaire and the Congo)	Ancient times	Congo Dog, Congo Terrier	The Basenji is square-proportioned and high on leg. This breed is far more slightly built and longer legged than most other primitive breeds, allowing a good amount of speed and the ability to perform the double-suspension gallop. The Basenji’s erect ears help locate game in thick bush and may act as heat dissipaters. This dog’s short coat also aids in dealing with the hot climate of Africa.	The Basenji is among the most primitive of breeds, discovered in the African Congo with Pygmy hunters. Early explorers called the dogs after the tribes that owned them or the area in which they were found, such as Zande dogs or Congo terriers. The native tribes used the dogs (which often wore a large bell) as pack hunters, driving game into nets.Early attempts to bring the dogs to England in the late 1800s and early 1900s were unsuccessful because they all succumbed to distemper. In the 1930s, a few dogs were successfully brought back to England and became the foundation (along with subsequent imports from the Congo and Sudan) of the breed outside of Africa.The name “Basenji,” meaning “bush thing,” was chosen. The early imports attracted much attention, and soon after dogs were brought to America. The breed’s popularity as a pet grew modestly but steadily. In the 1950s, a surge of popularity occurred as a result of a book and movie featuring a Basenji. The 1980s saw two important but controversial events for the Basenji in America. First, several Basenjis were brought from Africa in an attempt to widen the gene pool and combat some widespread hereditary health problems; some of these introduced the previously unrecognized brindle color into the breed. Second, the Basenji was recognized by the American Sighthound Field Association as a sighthound and allowed to compete in lure-coursing trials. This breed’s body structure and hunting style had previously been deemed too un-sighthound-like.The Basenji has always been hard to categorize. This breed retains several primitive characteristics, most notably its lack of barking ability and its yearly, rather than twice yearly, estrus cycle.	Some consider Basenjis to have terrier-like mannerisms because they are feisty for a hound. More often they are considered catlike in mannerisms: clever, inquisitive, stubborn, independent, and reserved. Their hunting roots are very evident, as they love to chase and trail. They need regular mental and physical stimulation lest it become frustrated and destructive. Basenjis may be barkless, but they are not mute. They do make a sort of yodel, howl, and shriek—and occasionally bark, but just one or two “fox barks” at a time. This breed gets along fairly well with other dogs, but often poorly with other Basenjis.	The Basenji is an active dog that needs daily mental and physical exercise. Their needs can be met by a long walk followed by a vigorous game or by free-running in a safe enclosed area. Coat care is minimal, consisting of only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	22	24	16	17
21	Basset Hound	2	2	2	4	3	3	3	1	2	2	3	3	Hound	Scenthound	France	1500s	\N	The Basset’s long, heavy body and short legs make this breed easy to follow on foot, and give it an edge in dense cover. The Basset Hound has heavier bone, in proportion to total size, than any other breed. This dog’s thick, tight coat protects from brambles without becoming caught in them. It is speculated that the long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The Basset’s movement is smooth and powerful; they tend to move with nose to the ground.	The first mention of the “Basset” dog is found in a sixteenth-century text about badger hunting. Dwarfed short-legged specimens occur in many breeds and have been known since ancient times, but it is difficult to know at what point such dogs were purposefully bred and which ones led to the present Basset Hound. There is, in fact, evidence that dwarfed hounds existed alongside full-sized hounds as long ago as the fifth century a.d. in France.The word Basset is derived from the French bas meaning low thing or dwarf, so that definitive evidence of the breed may be hard to follow. Short-legged dogs were used by the pre-Revolutionary French for hunting at a slower pace, but most of these dogs were dispersed, and their fates undocumented, during the French Revolution. The history becomes clearer after the Revolution, when greater numbers of commoners took up hunting, often aided by guns. They needed a dog that they could follow on foot, but that still had great scenting ability and strong heavy bone—in essence, a short-legged version of the pack hounds popular with the aristocracy. Because the Basset could not pursue quarry at speed, the quarry was less likely to be on the run and thus presented an easier target for the gunman. The dogs would hunt all mammals but were especially suited for rabbits and hares.Four different versions of short-legged hounds were created, with the Basset Artesien Normand most closely resembling today’s Basset. In the late 1800s (and again in 1930), crosses with Bloodhounds were made to increase size; the results were then tempered with subsequent crosses to the Artesien Normand.The first Bassets were brought to England and America in the late 1800s, and interest in the breed grew gradually. In 1885, the Basset Hound became one of the first breeds to be AKC recognized. By the mid 1900s, the Basset’s droll expression had won a place in advertising and entertainment and in many new pet owner’s hearts.	The Basset Hound is among the most good natured and easygoing of breeds. This breed is amiable with dogs, other pets, and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on this and all dogs’ backs with their games. The Basset is calm inside, but needs regular exercise in order to keep fit. They prefer to investigate slowly, and love to sniff and trail. These are talented and determined trackers, not easily dissuaded from their course. Because of this, they may get on a trail and follow it until becoming lost. This dog tends to be stubborn and slow moving. Bassets have a loud bay that they use when excited on the trail.	The Basset needs mild daily exercise, which can be satisfied by walking on leash or playing in the yard. The coat needs only minimal grooming, but the face may need regular cleaning around the mouth and wrinkles to combat odor. Bassets tend to drool.	40	60	14	14
22	Beagle	3	3	4	5	5	5	5	1	1	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	England	1300s	English Beagle	The Beagle should look like a miniature Foxhound, and is solid for the size. The Beagle’s moderate size enables the ability to follow on foot. Beagles can also be carried, and they can scurry around in thick underbrush. Their close hard coat protects them from underbrush. Their moderate build enables them to nimbly traverse rough terrain. The Beagle’s amiable personality allows this breed to get along with other dogs and to be a wonderful pet. Beagles are noted for their melodious bay. The deep muzzle allows more room for olfactory receptors, aiding the Beagle’s uncanny sense of smell.	By the fourteenth century, hare-hunting had become a popular sport in England, and the dogs used were probably of Beagle type. The origin of the name Beagle may be from old French words meaning open throat in reference to the breed’s melodious bay, or from the Celtic, old English, or old French words for small. The word Beagle was not used until 1475, however, but can then be found frequently in writings from the sixteenth century on.Hunters could follow these dogs on foot and could even carry one in a pocket if the need arose. By the 1800s, Beagles existed in several sizes, but the smaller “pocket-size” dogs were particularly popular. These dogs measured only about 9 inches and often needed the hunter’s assistance in crossing rough fields. One of the special appeals of the smaller Beagles was that the hunt could be followed even by “ladies, the aged, or the infirm,” as they slowly followed the winding path of the hare.The first mention of the Beagle in America was in 1642. Beagles were used in the South prior to the Civil War, but these dogs bore little resemblance to their English counterparts. After the war, English imports formed the basis of the modern American Beagle. By the end of the nineteenth century, Beagles were popular competitors in both field and conformation exhibitions. But the merry little scenthound did not stop there: the Beagle continued to become one of America’s all-time favorite breeds, finding a special niche as family pet.	One of the most amiable hounds, the Beagle was originally bred to be part of a pack and needs companionship, whether human or canine. This dog loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, the Beagle is a calm, tractable house pet. Beagles tend to be excellent with children, gentle, incredibly tolerant, and always ready to join in a game or adventure. This is an independent breed, however, and may run off if a trail beckons. Beagles bark and howl.	The Beagle needs daily exercise, either a long walk on leash or a romp in a safe area. Coat care requires only occasional brushing and bathing.	18	30	13	13
23	Bearded Collie	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	4	3	4	Herding	Herding	Scotland	1800s	\N	The Beardie is a medium-sized dog with a long, lean, strongly made body, which gives the impression of both strength and agility. This breed’s gait is supple and powerful, with good reach and drive. The ability to make sharp turns, quick starts, and sudden stops is essential in a sheep herding breed, and the Beardie must be able to keep this activity up for a long period of time under all conditions. This dog’s coat is double with a soft, furry undercoat. The outer coat is flat, harsh, and fairly straight; it is sufficient to protect the dog but not so much as to obscure the dog’s lines. The Beardie’s expression is bright and inquiring.	The Bearded Collie probably originated from the central European Magyar Komondor or Lowland Polish Sheepdog. In fact, records show that in 1514 two Lowland Polish Sheepdogs were brought to Scotland by Polish traders. Although dogs strongly resembling Bearded Collies are depicted in art dating from the eighteenth century, hard evidence of the breed cannot be found until the early nineteenth century, when the first breed description was published.These dogs were tireless herders of sheep and drovers of cattle over rough terrain in the cold Scottish mists. Long popular as a herding dog in Scotland, after the Victorian era the breed also gained favor as a show dog. Two strains, the Border strain, which was brown and white with a slightly wavy coat, and the Highland strain, which had a gray and white coat, have since been interbred and merged into one breed.After World War I, the Beardie was once again bred solely for work. Their value as herding dogs made it difficult for outsiders to acquire one from their shepherd owners. Eventually, however, a few breeders interested in showing Beardies were able to bring some dogs to England and then to America. The AKC recognized the breed in 1977. The Beardie has since become a popular pet and continues as a capable herder, although is more popular as a competitor in herding trials than as an actual working dog.	The boisterous Beardie is lively and playful, full of enthusiasm and energy. This dog is smart and obedient, but is an independent thinker with a clownish sense of humor. Beardies like children, but may be too rambunctious for small children and may try to herd them when playing.	This active dog needs either a good jog, a very long walk, or a vigorous play session every day. The Beardie especially enjoys herding. The long coat needs brushing or combing every other day.	45	55	20	22
24	Beauceron	4	4	3	3	1	2	1	5	5	1	3	5	Herding	Herding	France	1500s	Berger de Beauce, Bas-Rouge	The Beauceron is not a dog of extremes, but is a solid, balanced dog as befitting a true multipurpose dog ready to do a long day’s work. This breed’s body is powerful yet agile, jaws are strong, and gait is fluid, effortless, and ground covering. The head is not held high when moving, but is lowered to the level of the back, as is typical of herding dogs. The Beauceron’s outer coat is straight, dense, and coarse, of medium length; this, combined with a dense undercoat, offers weather-resistant protection. An unusual trait is the presence of double dewclaws on the hindlegs, which seem to be a French tradition for herding and flock dogs. Although they serve no function, they were perhaps at one time associated with the best herders, and are now a breed trademark.	The Beauceron is an entirely French breed, dating back as far as the late 1500s. The breed originated in the plains area surrounding Paris known as La Beauce. The largest of the French sheepdogs, the Beauceron was used as a general-purpose farm dog, driving and protecting sheep and sometimes, cattle, and protecting the family.In 1863 two types of plains flock-herding and guarding dogs were differentiated: the long-coated Berger de Brie (Briard) and the short-coated Berger de Beauce (Beauceron). The Société Centrale Canine registered the first Berger de Beauce in 1893, and the first breed club was formed in 1922.Well known as the preferred herding dog in France, the breed remained virtually unknown outside of France. The French army employed Beaucerons as messenger dogs on the front lines during both world wars. The breed’s uncanny ability to follow directions, follow trails, and detect mines still makes them a respected military and police dog. They also serve their families as protection dogs.In the 1960s a concerted effort was made to preserve the qualities of native French breeds, and since that time, the Beauceron’s popularity in France and elsewhere has grown. In 1980 the Beauceron Club of America formed, and in 2001 the AKC admitted the Beauceron into the Miscellaneous class. They are making their presence felt by excelling in obedience, tracking, agility, Schutzhund, and of course, herding.	Beaucerons are intelligent and adept at any task involving learning, memory, and reasoning. They are courageous and calm, and make reliable guardians. This is an extremely loyal breed that is eager to please; however, if not properly trained, the Beauceron can run the family. Beaucerons are patient with children, but can be overwhelming to them or try to herd them. They may be wary of strangers and do not take to strange dogs. They can get along with other family pets.	This is a dog with an active mind and athletic body, and needs mental and physical exercise every day. Without adequate stimulation, the Beauceron can become bored and destructive. Don’t adopt a Beauceron unless you commit to taking time to train and provide regular exercise. Coat care is minimal, consisting of brushing once a week or so.	65	85	24	28
25	Bedlington Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	2	4	1	2	5	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	Rothbury Terrier	This graceful, lithe dog has a distinctive silhouette. This breed’s arched loin and racy outline allow great speed and agility. A wolf in lamb’s clothing, the Bedlington is unrivaled in ability to chase and engage agile but tough quarry. The gait is light and springy. The coat is a mixture of hard and soft hair standing off the skin, affording good protection as well as outstanding appearance.	One of the most unusual members of the terrier group is the Bedlington Terrier. This breed comes from England, hailing from the Hanny Hills of Northumberland. The exact origin is obscure, but in the late eighteenth century a strain of game terriers was developed that became known as Rothbury Terriers. In 1825, Joseph Ainsley of the town of Bedlington bred two of his Rothbury Terriers and christened their offspring a Bedlington Terrier. Occasional crosses to other breeds arguably included the Whippet (for speed) and Dandie Dinmont Terrier (for coat), but no documented evidence of such crosses exist, and some breed historians assert that such crosses were never made. Whatever the process, the result was an agile, effective game terrier.By the late 1800s, the breed had stepped into the show ring as well as into the homes of the more elite. At one time the liver color was more popular, although the blue has since passed it in popularity. The Bedlington’s lamb-like appearance draws many admirers, but the emphasis on trimming eventually dampened the breed’s popularity as a show dog. With more easily available grooming tools and instructions, the Bedlington has regained much of its popularity with the public.	The Bedlington is among the softer terriers, not only in looks and feel but in temperament. This breed is companionable, demonstrative, and loyal. They enjoy creature comforts and are fairly quiet. Even though they will seldom initiate a fight, Bedlingtons will not allow themselves to be intimidated by other dogs and can be a scrappy fighter when pushed. They will give chase to small animals outdoors, but can usually coexist with them indoors.	The Bedlington needs daily exercise in a safe place; this dog loves to run and chase. Their needs can be met with a good long walk or vigorous romp. Their coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus professional grooming to shape the coat every other month. Hair that is shed tends to cling to the other hair rather than shedding.	17	23	16	17
28	Belgian Shepherd Dog	5	5	5	5	3	3	3	3	5	4	1	4	Shepherd	Herding (UKC)	Belgium	1800s	\N	The Belgian Shepherd Dog is a majestic yet hardy dog of medium size and good proportion. Versatile and adaptable, he is quick and agile, with the endurance needed to herd flocks of sheep all day, the purpose for which he was originally bred.	A native breed to Belgium dating back to the 1800s that was developed to herd sheep, the Belgian Shepherd Dog became popular for his abilities as a smart, adaptable working dog. The Club due Chien de Berger Belge (Belgian Shepherd Dog Club) was formed in 1891 as a means to define consistency for these native dogs, which were identical anatomically but different in terms of their coat texture, length and color. Of those varieties, the black long-haired dog was called Groenendael; the fawn rough-haired dog, Laekenois; the fawn short-haired masked dog, Malinois; and fawn long-haired masked dog, Tervuren. Having been imported to the United States in the 1900s, today, these four varieties are viewed as a single breed, the Belgian Shepherd Dog, as recognized by the United Kennel Club since 1991.	Alert, intelligent and inquisitive, the Belgian Shepherd Dog also is a loyal, vigilant watchdog and eager-to-please, tenacious guardian for his human family. Although somewhat reserved around strangers, the Belgian Shepherd Dog is warm and friendly with those he adores.	The Belgian Shepherd Dog is accustomed to an active life outdoors. As such, he requires plenty of daily exercise, such as a long walk or free play in a fenced yard, as well as ample mental stimulation. Proper training and socialization is a must for this sensitive breed, as is a confident and firm owner to be the alpha. Because the Belgian Shepherd Dog is a true herding breed, take caution around children, as his natural herding tendencies can kick in. He does well with other dogs and pets, too, provided he’s been properly introduced. The Belgian Shepherd Dog has a long, straight coat that heavily sheds seasonally. Daily brushing is needed, as is the occasional bath and regular nail trimming, teeth brushing and ear cleaning.	40	65	22	26
27	Belgian Shepherd Sheepdog	4	5	4	4	3	3	1	5	5	3	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Belgium	1800s	Groenendael	The Belgian Sheepdog is an elegant, square-proportioned dog that is alert and agile with proud carriage. This breed’s bone is moderately heavy. For dogs expected to herd for long hours, their gait is smooth, tireless, and effortless rather than driving. They have a tendency to move in a circle rather than a straight line. They have an extremely dense undercoat along with an outer coat of abundant guard hairs that are long, well-fitting, and straight. The texture should be medium-harsh, not silky, for protection. The undercoat is extremely dense in cold weather for insulation. The opening of the ear is protected by tufts of hair. The Belgian Sheepdog’s expression is intelligent and questioning, and the black coloration is striking.	The Belgian Sheepdog, Belgian Tervuren, and Belgian Malinois began as three local variations of one breed, which was known as the Belgian Shepherd or Continental Shepherd. The dog that was heir to the name Belgian Sheepdog was originally known as the Groenendael variation of the breed. Like all the Belgian shepherds, this was a working farm dog expected to both herd and guard. This breed differed from the others because it had a rather long, black coat.In 1910 these dogs were officially dubbed Groenendael after the kennel that had selectively bred the black dogs since 1893 (just after the Belgian Shepherds were recognized as a breed). By this time, the breed had gained some repute as a police dog and was already employed in this capacity in America. In World War I, they continued to shine as sentry dogs, messengers, and even draft dogs. It was here that they captured the attention of the public, and they soon enjoyed a fair amount of popularity after the war.In 1959, the three Belgian Shepherd breeds were divided into separate breeds, with the Groenendael subsequently known as the Belgian Sheepdog. With their shimmering black coat, these are the most striking of the Belgian breeds, and that fact, along with their versatile abilities, have won them many faithful supporters.	Ever watchful and on the move, the Belgian Sheepdog glides in large circles. They are playful, alert, watchful, protective, independent, and intense dogs. They are aloof with strangers and should be introduced carefully to other dogs and household pets. Some can be domineering. They are intelligent and biddable, but independent. They are protective of their home and family.	The Belgian Sheepdog needs a good deal of exercise, either a good long jog or a long, strenuous play session. They need room to move during the day and do best with access to a yard. Their double coat needs brushing and combing twice weekly, more when shedding.	40	75	22	26
30	Bernese Mountain Dog	2	3	2	3	3	4	3	2	4	3	5	3	Working	Livestock dog, Mountain dog, Mastiff	Switzerland	Ancient times	Berner Sennenhund, Bernese Cattle Dog	The Bernese Mountain Dog is slightly longer than tall, though appearing square. This breed is a sturdy, large, hardy dog with a combination of strength, speed, and agility. The Bernese’s natural working gait is a slow trot, but with good reach and drive. The thick coat is moderately long, and slightly wavy or straight, providing insulation from the cold. The expression is gentle, and the color is striking.	The most well known of the Sennehunde, or Swiss mountain dogs, the Bernese is distinguished by being the only one to have a fairly long, silky coat. The origin of the breed is speculative at best. Some experts believe this breed’s history traces to the Roman invasion of Switzerland, when the Roman mastiffs were crossed with native flock-guarding dogs. This cross produced a strong dog that was able to withstand the Alpine weather and that could serve as draft dog, flock guard, drover, herder, and general farm dog.Despite their utility, little attempt was made to perpetuate them as a breed purposefully. By the late 1800s, the breed was in danger of being lost. At that time, Professor Albert Heim initiated a study of Swiss dogs that led to the identification of the Bernese Mountain Dog as one of the existing types. These dogs were found only in the valleys of the lower Alps. Through Dr. Heim’s efforts, these dogs were promoted throughout Switzerland and even Europe. The finest specimens came to be found in the Durrbach area, at one time giving the breed the name Durrbachler. With the breed’s spread, the name was changed to Bernese Mountain Dog. The first Bernese came to America in 1926; official AKC recognition was granted in 1937.	The Bernese Mountain Dog is an easygoing, calm family companion (that is, after the adolescent stage). This dog is sensitive, loyal, extremely devoted, gentle with children, and often reserved with strangers. The Bernese generally gets along well with other dogs and pets. They do not do well isolated from family activities.	The Bernese enjoys the outdoors, especially in cold weather. This dog needs daily but moderate exercise, either a good hike or walk on leash. The coat needs brushing one or two times weekly, much more often when shedding. The Bernese life span is described by a Swiss expression: “Three years a young dog, three years a good dog, and three years an old dog. All else is a gift from God.”	70	120	23	28
31	Bichon Frise	4	2	5	5	4	4	5	1	4	5	3	4	Non-sporting	Barbichon, Water Dog	Mediterranean area	Ancient times	Bichon Tenerife, Bichon a Poil Frise	The striking powder-puff appearance of the Bichon derives from a double coat, with a soft dense undercoat and coarser, curly outercoat, causing the coat to stand off the body and even spring back when patted. This is a merry, agile breed with an effortless and efficient gait. The Bichon’s looks and fitness make this sturdy little dog a popular family addition. The soft, inquisitive expression enables this breed to worm its way into many hearts and laps.	The Bichon Frise has roots in the Mediterranean, originally produced by crossing the Barbet (a large water dog) with small coated, often white dogs. This cross eventually produced a family of dogs known as barbichons, which was later shortened to bichons. The bichons were divided into four types: the Maltaise, Bolognese, Havanese, and Tenerife. The Tenerife, considered to be one of the sources of the Bichon Frise, developed on the Canary Island of Tenerife, probably having been taken there by Spanish seafarers in ancient times. In the fourteenth century, Italian sailors brought these dogs back from the island to the Continent, where they quickly became favored pets of the upper class.Following a series of French invasions of Italy in the 1500s, the little dogs (known there as Bolgnese) were adopted by the French. They were special pets of Francis I and his successor, Henry III. They also enjoyed popularity in Spain, but for some reason, the breed’s popularity waned throughout Europe. The Bichon experienced a brief resurgence during the reign of Napoleon III in the early nineteenth century, but once again quickly faded from favor. This began a new chapter in the Bichon’s history, as the breed sank from court favorite to common street dog. The Bichons survived, however, because of their propensity for performing tricks, and they teamed with peddlers and organ grinders to entertain passersby for money.With the advent of World War I, the little dogs were nearly lost. A few dogs were brought back home by soldiers, but no real effort to save the Bichon was made until a few French breeders began an earnest effort to establish the breed. In 1933, the FCI adopted a breed standard and officially named it the Bichon Frise. The breed was threatened again, this time by World War II. It was not until it came to America in the 1950s that its future became secure. Even then, the breed did not catch on until recommended grooming was updated and it received greater publicity in the 1960s. The breed suddenly started catching attention and was recognized by the AKC in 1971.	Perky, bouncy, and playful, the Bichon Frise’s happy-go-lucky outlook is endearing to all. This dog is friendly toward strangers and other dogs and pets, and is very good with children. Bichons are sensitive, responsive, and affectionate, as eager to cuddle as they are to play. They doesn’t like to be left alone, and can bark a lot. Bichons can be hard to housetrain.	The Bichon is an active dog that needs vigorous indoor games or, better, a romp in the yard or a short walk on leash daily. The white powderpuff coat needs brushing and combing every other day, plus professional grooming every month. This dog doesn’t shed, but the loose hairs become entangled in the coat and can mat. Bichons may be difficult to keep white in some areas.	10	16	10	12
32	Black and Tan Coonhound	2	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1700s	American Black and Tan Coonhound	The Black and Tan Coonhound’s moderate build allows a blend of strength, speed and agility. This breed is square or slightly longer than tall, with moderate bone. The Coonhound’s long ears may help stir up ground scents, and the deep muzzle allows room for olfactory apparatus. The hair is short but dense, providing an all-weather-protective coat. The expression is alert, friendly, and eager. The stride is easy and graceful, with head and tail held high. The Coonhound has a deep voice.	A true American breed, the Black and Tan Coonhound probably originated from crosses of the Bloodhound and the Foxhound, particularly the black and tan Virginia Foxhound. The Black and Tan Coonhound developed mostly in the Appalachian, Blue Ridge, Ozark, and Smokey Mountains, where these dogs were used to hunt raccoons and bears over fairly rugged terrain. They trailed in the fashion of their Bloodhound ancestors, with nose to ground but at a somewhat swifter pace. Although they would trail any mammal, they specialized in raccoons and opossums, often trailing at night. The dogs would bay when the quarry was treed.The “American Black and Tan Fox and Coonhound” was the first coonhound breed recognized by the UKC in 1900. The AKC recognized the breed in 1945—the only coonhound breed the AKC recognized for decades—and is now popular as a pet.	Not the prototypical member of the household, the Black and Tan Coonhound, nonetheless, makes an exemplary pet. This dog is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors. Outdoors, this breed can be difficult, if not impossible, to turn from a track after trailing a scent. As befitting a dog with this heritage, the Coonhound is strong, independent, and stubborn. While gentle and tolerant with children, but they may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. They are reserved with strangers. They may bay and howl.	The Black and Tan is a dog that can run for miles, although is usually content with a moderate jog or long walk, with an occasional excursion into the field. They can wander if they catch a scent, so a safe area is mandatory. Their coat needs only occasional brushing. Most Coonhounds drool to some extent, and the face may need regular wiping. The ears should also be checked regularly.	55	75	23	25
33	Black Russian Terrier	2	3	2	4	3	4	1	5	3	3	4	5	Working	Schnauzer	Soviet Union	1950s	Chornyi, Terrier Noir Russem, Russian Black Terrier, Schwarzer Russischer Terrier, Tchiorny Terrier, Svart Terrier, Mustaterrieri	The Black Russian Terrier is strong of body and mind. This is a large-boned and well-muscled dog, strong and agile to traverse rocky terrain or overtake an adversary. The head and neck are powerful. A reliable intelligent temperament is essential in a dog that also has strong protective instincts; courage is also a must.The weatherproof outer coat repels water while the undercoat insulates the dog from the cold. Length of coat should vary from 1.5″ to 4″ with longer coats detracting from the dog’s working ability.	In the 1940s the Soviets faced the task of populating their military with suitable working dogs. With a dearth of qualified canines, they imported breeds from their occupied countries, mainly German breeds, into their state Red Star kennels. The most impressive of their imports was a Giant Schnauzer named Roy, born in 1947. Roy was bred extensively with females from various breeds, with the most successful coming from Airedale Terrier, Rottweiler, and Moscow Water Dog crosses. They were all black, and were distinguished from the others as the “Black Terrier” group. The best were bred among themselves, and by 1957 second- and third-generation dogs were presented to the public.Besides sharing border guard duty with soldiers, military tasks included detecting mines and explosives, transporting supplies, pulling sledges, and finding wounded soldiers, all done independently and in the harshest of climates. Black Russian Terriers served in military operations in Afghanistan and Bosnia.In 1968 a breed standard was registered with the international FCI, which officially recognized the breed in 1984. As BRT breeders emigrated to other countries, the dogs’ value as companions became more obvious, and their popularity spread. In 2001 the AKC admitted the breed into its Miscellaneous class, and in 2004 the Black Russian Terrier became a regular member of the Working Group.	Calm, confident, and courageous sums up the Black Russian Terrier. Reserved with strangers, BRTs are very attached to and protective of their family. They are fast learners, but also independent thinkers, and they can be stubborn if pushed to do something they don’t want to do. BRTs are affectionate and social. They tend to stick close to their people, even inside the house. They are gentle and playful with children. They may not be good with strange or dominant dogs, but are fine with other pets and smaller canine housemates.	BRTs need social interaction as well as mental and physical exercise. Obedience or agility training is helpful in channeling the breed’s need for work. They are quiet inside. They do not bark frivolously. The BRT doesn’t shed much, but the coat needs thorough combing once or twice a week, and trimming every six to eight weeks. The coat should appear tousled.	80	145	26	30
34	Bloodhound	3	3	1	5	3	5	3	1	1	1	4	4	Hound	Scenthound	Belgium, England	Middle Ages	St. Hubert's Hound, Chien St. Hubert	The Bloodhound is a steadfast trailer, built for endurance rather than speed. The skin is thin and loose, falling in wrinkles around the head and throat. This breed’s long ears are supposed to stir up scents as the ears rake along the ground, and its profuse wrinkles are said to trap the odors around the face, although neither of these assertions has ever been scientifically verified. The dense short coat provides protection from being caught in brambles. The Bloodhound’s docile temperament makes this dog nonthreatening to humans. The gait is elastic and free, with the tail held high. The expression is noble and dignified.	The quintessential scenthound, the Bloodhound’s roots trace back to ancient times. Their earliest ancestor may have been the black St. Huberts hound documented in Europe by the eighth century. William the Conqueror is credited with bringing these hounds to England in 1066. In the twelfth century, many Church dignitaries were interested in hunting with these dogs, and most monasteries kept carefully bred packs. So highly bred were these dogs that they came to be known as “blooded hounds,” referring to their pure blood and noble breeding.Bloodhounds have been known in America since the mid 1800s. The Bloodhound has since proved itself to be one of the most useful of breeds, using its unrivaled sense of smell to trail lost persons and criminals alike. After the person is located, the Bloodhound’s job is over because they are never inclined to attack.The Bloodhound holds many trailing records (for both length and age of trail), and at one time was the only breed of dog whose identifications were accepted in a court of law. Ironically, the Bloodhound’s name and bad press scared many people away from the breed because they believed stories that claimed the dogs trailed people out of a lust for blood. Nothing, of course, could be farther from the truth. The breed is well known to all but not particularly popular as a pet, however is an unsurpassed working trailer.For all their calm manners at home, Bloodhounds are tireless trailers once on the track. They are tough, stubborn, and independent, yet are so gentle and placid that they are extremely trustworthy around children—although they may not be playful enough for some children’s needs. Nonetheless, they are not the lazy ol’ hound dog portrayed in folklore but instead active, playful companions. Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, Bloodhounds are exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing. The Bloodhound is reserved with strangers.	The Bloodhound needs a good deal of daily exercise. This dog was bred to trail through any hardship, and once on a trail cannot be called off. Therefore this breed must be exercised in a safe area.	Bloodhounds drool a lot, so their facial wrinkles require daily cleaning; the ear tips drag in food and must also be kept clean. The ear canals also need regular cleaning for good health. Coat care is minimal, requiring only occasional brushing or wiping. This is not the breed for people obsessed with cleanliness in the house!	80	90	23	27
35	Bluetick Coonhound	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	1	1	3	3	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1800s	\N	The Bluetick should have the appearance of a speedy and well-muscled hound. Although more strongly built than some other coonhounds, this breed should never be clumsy nor overly chunky in build. The legs are moderately angulated and well muscled, allowing for good speed, agility and endurance. The wide nostrils allow air and scent in, and the deep muzzle allows for more scenting receptor area. The coat is short and medium coarse, providing protection from brambles. In motion he carries his head and tail well up. The distinctive loud bawl allows the hunter to follow the dog from a distance and at night.	The Bluetick Coonhound’s early history is shared with the American English Coonhound. This breed’s forbearers were English hunting hounds that came to America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Among the early breeders was George Washington, who combined English foxhounds with French hounds. Continued crosses to the slow-trailing but resolute French Grand Bleu de Gascogne produced larger dogs with black ticking and, more importantly, a slower hunting style with better ability to follow old (“cold”) scent trails.Much of the breed’s development took place in the Louisiana bayous and Tennessee Ozarks. The dogs were initially considered a subtype of English Coonhounds, which were recognized by the UKC in 1905. As the preference for English Coonhounds began to favor faster, hot-nosed dogs, breeders of the blue-ticked ones broke away from them, with UKC granting separate breed status in 1945. The Bluetick became a regular member of the AKC Hound Group in 2009. The breed has remained a favorite, with a reputation of staying on the toughest and most confusing trails and for persistence when treeing. When on the trail the Bluetick has a strong bawl.	Friendly, adventurous, independent, and strong-willed, the Bluetick is a generally laid-back but not overly obedient companion. Notorious counter surfers and escape artists, they like to follow their nose to food or quarry—and will pretend to be deaf to pleas to stop. Their easy going nature makes them a friend to all, enjoying the company of strangers, other dogs, and even other animals (if raised with them). They enjoy baying—loudly— when excited.	The Bluetick is happiest in the woods following a challenging trail. Even suburban Blueticks should have the chance to follow scent trails and to take in new scents regularly. More of an endurance runner than sprinter, the Bluetick needs a long walk or jog daily. The Bluetick is calm indoors as long as he gets a daily outing. Food must be kept well out of reach. Coat care consists of occasional brushing.	45	80	21	27
36	Boerboel	3	3	2	3	1	2	1	5	2	1	3	5	Working	Mastiff	South Africa	1800s	\N	The Boerboel is a large, muscular dog showing strength and agility in motion. This dog can be strong enough to overpower and nimble enough to avoid a wide variety of dangerous African animals. This breed is also intelligent enough to recognize danger, courageous enough to face it, and cautious enough to stay clear. The jaws are particularly strong. The coat is short but dense. The skin is thick and loose for added protection. The Boerboel is well pigmented to protect against the African sun. The dog is slightly longer than tall, with powerful free-flowing movement.	When Jan van Riebeeck and company arrived in South Africa in 1652 to establish a trading post (Cape Town) for the Dutch East India Company, they brought their Bullenbijters with them for protection. Subsequent colonists also brought large protective dogs. More Bulldog and Mastiff breeds arrived with British settlers in the 1800s. These dogs all interbred and were further dispersed northward during the Great Trek beginning in 1838. They were likely also crossed with native African dogs, and the Rhodesian Ridgeback may have even played a role.The name Boerboel (pronounced BUR-bul) means “farmer’s dog.” The boers (Dutch/Afrikaans for “farmers”) used the dogs for protection from dangerous animals and humans in the sparsely populated land, often keeping large numbers of them around the farm. During the day, the dogs would disperse to different duties—protecting farm animals, guiding oxen, or accompanying the farmer.In 1938, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to guard their South African mines, and these dogs were subsequently integrated into the Boerboel gene pool. In the early 1980s, two individuals searched Africa for authentic Boerboel dogs, eventually locating 250 and selecting 72 for registration. The breed has since spread throughout the world. It was recognized as a member of the AKC Working group in 2015.	The Boerboel is a confident dog known for being protective of both property and people. This is a strong-willed working dog with an intelligent nature, thus, this is not a dog for a novice owner. They tend to be aloof with strangers but are extremely affectionate with those they know. The Boerboel requires proper, ongoing training and socialization from an early age to prevent over-assertiveness and other behavior issues from forming.	Boerboels need a medium level of activity. A long walk or short jogging venture will usually satisfy their exercise needs. This is not a good breed for dog parks. They enjoy challenging sports such as tracking. Coat care is minimal, consisting of an occasional bath or brushing. They do well outside in temperate climates.	100	180	22	27
37	Border Collie	5	5	4	3	3	1	2	3	5	3	3	4	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Great Britain	1800s	\N	This is a medium dog of strong bone, slightly longer than tall, combining grace, agility, substance, and stamina. The Border Collie’s trot is smooth, ground covering, and tireless, moving with stealth and strength. They are able to change speed and direction suddenly. This breed can display incredible agility even after working for long periods. The coat can be either smooth or rough. The smooth coat is short all over the body; the rough coat is medium to long in length and flat to slightly wavy in texture. The BC’s expression is intelligent, alert, eager, and full of interest, a reflection of its temperament.	The consummate sheepdog, the Border Collie is the result of over a century of breeding for function above all other criteria. In the 1800s, a variety of sheep herding dogs with differing herding styles existed in Great Britain. Some were “fetching” dogs, dogs having an innate tendency to circle sheep and bring them back toward the shepherd. Most of these were noisy dogs, tending to nip and bark as they performed their job.Boasts of the superiority of certain dogs were only natural; in 1873 the first actual sheepdog trial was held in order to settle some of these boasts. This contest would indirectly lead to the first Border Collies, by way of a dog named Hemp, so distinguished himself in trials. He herded not by barking and nipping, but by calmly staring at the sheep (“giving eye”) intimidating them into moving. Hemp is considered to be the father of the Border Collie.In 1906, the first standard was drawn up, but unlike the physical standards of most breeds, this was a description of working ability, with no regard to physical appearance. This emphasis has shaped the breed ever since. In fact, the dogs were still referred to simply as sheepdogs; only in 1915 was the name Border Collie first recorded, in reference to the dog’s origin around the English and Scottish borders.Border Collies came to America and instantly dazzled serious shepherds with their quick herding and obedience capabilities. In fact, the latter opened a new door for the breed as one of the top competitive breeds in obedience trials. Having worked hard to gain the reputation of one of the smartest breeds of dogs, a breed unspoiled by cosmetic emphasis, many Border Collie fans actively fought AKC recognition as a show dog. In 1995, however, the AKC officially recognized the breed.	The Border Collie is a bundle of mental and physical energy awaiting a chance to be unleashed on the world. Among the most intelligent and obedient of breeds, the BC is nonetheless a disastrous family member if not given a challenging job every day. Given sufficient exercise, they are dependable and loyal companions. They are intent on whatever they do and tend to stare, which can be unnerving to other animals. They also like to chase other animals. They are reserved, even protective, toward strangers. Without a job, BCs can be destructive and can develop harmful, compulsive habits.	Few dogs are as work oriented as the Border Collie. These are dogs that need a job and a lot of physical and mental activity every day to satisfy their quest for work. This is a dog that cannot live in an apartment and that should preferably have ready access to a yard. The coat needs brushing or combing twice weekly.	30	45	18	23
38	Border Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	4	3	3	4	Terrier	Terrier	Border of Scotland and England	1700s	\N	The Border Terrier is of medium bone, slightly taller than long. Their long legs impart the speed, agility, and endurance necessary to follow a horse over all sorts of terrain, whereas their fairly narrow body allows them to squeeze through narrow passages in pursuit of a fox. Their gait displays good length of stride. Their coat consists of a short, dense undercoat covered by a very wiry, straight, somewhat broken outer coat, which should conform to the body. Their hide is very thick and loose fitting, affording protection. Borders are known for their distinctive otter head, and their alert expression matches their alert demeanor.	Perhaps the oldest of Britain’s terriers, the Border Terrier originated around the Cheviot Hills forming the border country between Scotland and England. The dog originated to chase and bolt (or remain underground and bark at) the fox that were considered a nuisance to farmers. The smallest of the long-legged terriers, the Border Terrier had to be fast enough to keep up with a horse yet small enough to go in after the fox once it had gone to ground.The first evidence of these dogs dates from the eighteenth century. Their progenitors are unknown, although hey are probably related to the Dandie Dinmont and possibly Bedlington Terriers. The breed was once known as the Coquetdale Terrier or Redesdale Terrier, but the name Border Terrier, taken from the Border Hunt, was adopted in 1870. By this time, the breed had risen from its utilitarian roots to take a valued place alongside the Foxhounds in the gentry’s elegant foxhunts.The first Border Terrier was shown in the 1870s. The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1930. Less flashy than many other terriers, the Border continued to be better appreciated by patrons of the hunt than of the show ring.Unlike many terriers, the breed has changed very little since it was recognized. In recent years, these dogs have experienced a rise in popularity and are fast becoming a fairly popular pet. They are especially popular in the United Kingdom, where they are among the ten most popular breeds.	The Border is one of the most amiable and tractable of the Terrier group. This breed is inquisitive, busy, friendly, and biddable. They do like to track and can be independent, ingredients that make for a dog that may tend to roam if given the chance. Borders are generally good with other dogs and cats, but not with small animals. They are very good with children and make a good companion for people of all ages. They dig, and some bark. Some are talented escape artists.	The Border likes activity and needs either a good walk on leash, a vigorous game session, or an off-lead expedition in a safe area every day. The harsh coat needs brushing weekly, plus stripping of dead hairs about four times yearly to maintain its clean outline.	12	16	10	11
39	Borzoi	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	4	2	Hound	Sighthound	Russia	Middle Ages	Russian Wolfhound	The Borzoi is a hound capable of running in a very cold climate, and has strong jaws. This breed retains the greyhound build necessary for running at great speed, but is larger and stronger than the greyhound. The long, silky coat, which can be either flat, wavy, or rather curly, provides protection against cold weather and snow. The Borzoi should possess elegance and grace, with flowing lines, whether standing or moving.	The Borzoi (also known as the Russian Wolf-hound) was bred by the Russian aristocracy for hundreds of years. Coursing for sport was known in Russia as early as the thirteenth century. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, crosses of coursing hounds with bearhounds and with tall Russian sheepdogs were made to increase size and coat, both necessary for hunting in the cold climateThe first standard was written in the 1600s in a book of Borzoi hunting rules. Perhaps no other breed has ever been the focus of hunting on such a grand scale. Hundreds of serfs worked in the upkeep of the hounds on huge estates; the hunts themselves were grand events. One account describes the hounds, horses, and hunters arriving in a train of over 40 cars, with another train bringing the Grand Duke and other nobility. Over 100 Borzoi might partake in a hunt.By the 1800s, seven distinct subtypes of Borzoi existed in Russia. Most present Borzoi descend from the Perchino type kept by the Grand Duke Nicolai Nicolayevitch, and many of the early American imports came directly from the Perchino kennels. The Russian Czar would often present Borzoi as gifts to visiting royalty.After the Russian Revolution, the days of the nobility were over, and the breed began to disappear. The fate of the breed was left in the hands of foreign royalty who had been given Borzoi and of a few remaining Borzoi kennels. In America, the Borzoi soon gained the reputation as the ultimate glamour dog, often seen at the sides of movie stars. Although only enjoying modest popularity as a pet, the breed remains popularity as a model.	A breed of quiet elegance, the Borzoi exemplifies the well-mannered family member indoors. Outdoors, they race with wild abandon, and will chase any small animal that runs. They are independent but very sensitive. Although generally good with children, they may not be playful enough to satisfy some children. Some can be timid. They are reserved with strangers.	The Borzoi needs the chance for daily exertion. Although a long walk can satisfy most of their needs, it should be combined with a sprint in a large safe area. The coat, which is characteristically fuller on males, needs brushing or combing two or three times a week; at times it sheds a lot.	60	105	28	30
40	Boston Terrier	3	1	3	3	3	4	3	1	3	1	5	5	Non-sporting	Terrier, Mastiff, Bull	United States	1800s	\N	The Boston Terrier is a compactly built, square-proportioned, short-backed, clean-cut dog. This breed conveys the impression of determination, strength, sturdiness, liveliness, and style, with a graceful carriage. The Boston retains many of the attributes of his Bulldog ancestors, but in a clean-cut package that makes a handy house companion. The short fine coat, with distinctive markings, adds to this breed’s dapper appearance.	Unlike most breeds, the origin of the Boston Terrier is well documented. Around 1865, the coachmen employed by the wealthy people of Boston began to interbreed some of their employers’ fine dogs. One of these crosses, between an English Terrier and a Bulldog, resulted in a dog named Hooper’s Judge. He and his offspring provided the foundation for the Boston Terrier.By 1889, the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that the American Bull Terrier Club was formed, but this proposed name for the breed was not well received by Bull Terrier fans. The breed’s nickname, roundheads, was similarly inappropriate. Shortly after, the breed was named the Boston Terrier, after its birthplace.The Boston’s rise from nonexistence to AKC recognition was meteoric by modern standards, as the breed was recognized by the AKC in 1893, less than 20 years after the breed was born. Breeders continued to seek greater consistency. In early years, color and markings were not particularly important, but by the early 1900s, the breed’s distinctive markings had become an essential breed feature. The handsome little Boston Terrier quickly gained favor throughout America, ranking as one of the most popular breeds in the early to middle 1900s and retaining great popularity today.	The Boston is devoted and sensitive to his family’s wishes and moods. This dog is well-mannered indoors but saucy and playful (especially enjoying ball chasing) whenever the chance arises. Somewhat stubborn, Bostons are nonetheless clever and learn readily. Thy are reserved with strangers, and some may be assertive toward strange dogs, and should be introduced carefully. Some bark a lot.	This is a lively dog that needs daily exercise and interaction with his family. They love games, and most of their exercise requirements can be met with a romp in the yard or a short walk on leash. Some Bostons wheeze and snore, and many don’t tolerate heat well. The coat requires only minimal care, an occasional brushing to remove dead hairs.	10	25	15	17
26	Belgian Shepherd Malinois	4	5	4	1	3	3	1	5	5	1	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Belgium	1800s	Chien de Berger Belge	The Belgian Malinois is a sturdy dog of square proportion with moderately heavy, but oval, bone. This breed is elegant, with very proud head carriage. The overall impression is of power without bulkiness. The gait is smooth and easy, seemingly effortless rather than hard driving. Such a gait gives the impression of tirelessness. The Malinois has a tendency to run in a wide circle rather than a straight line. The coat is fairly short, straight, and hard, with a dense undercoat. The expression is intelligent and questioning.	The Belgian sheepherding breeds, collectively known as Chiens de Berger Belge, shared their early history as general-purpose shepherds and guard dogs of Belgium. As working dogs, they were bred for ability rather than esthetics, and no careful records were kept. Thus, when dog shows became popular in the late 1800s, it was not clear if Belgium had any recognizable breeds with which they could tout their national pride.In 1891, Professor Reul was asked to study the native dogs to see if they could be sorted into distinct breeds. He found a group of similar dogs that differed only in coat type and color, all of which were grouped as Belgian Shepherds. The short-haired variety was developed in the area around Malines, and so became known as the Belgian Malinois.This breed remains the most popular of the Belgian shepherd breeds in its native land, but has had a rockier road in America. Between 1911 and World War II, the Malinois enjoyed a good deal of popularity in America. After the war, registrations plummeted, and it was rare to find a Malinois entered in competition. When the breeds were separated in 1959, Malinois registrations began to grow once again, but they still fell far behind the other Belgian breeds.More recently, the Malinois is becoming popular because of its reputation as one of the preeminent police dogs in the world, surpassing even the German Shepherd in demand. Thus, even though these dogs may not be seen in many homes, they are making their presence known as keepers of the peace throughout the world.	Intense best describes the Belgian Malinois. This is a high-energy breed with a need for regular mental and physical stimulation. These dogs are alert, smart, and serious. They can be aloof with strangers and should be introduced to other dogs and animals carefully. Some can be domineering. When confined, they often run in sweeping circles in an effort to stay on the move. They are protective of their home and family.	The Malinois is a high-energy dog that needs a lot of exercise. Their needs cannot be met with a leisurely walk on leash. They instead need a good jog or a vigorous play session. They especially enjoy herding. Their coat needs weekly brushing, more when shedding.	60	65	22	26
41	Bouvier des Flandres	3	4	2	3	3	3	3	5	3	4	4	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Belgium	1600s	Belgian Cattle Dog	This is a versatile breed able to perform a variety of functions, including herder, worker, and protector. As such, this dog combines great strength with agility and endurance. The Bouvier des Flandres is a compact, short-coupled dog, of square proportion and rugged appearance. The Bouvier’s gait is free, bold, and proud. The weatherproof coat is tousled and double, with a fine undercoat and a harsh, dry outer coat. The coat is trimmed (if necessary) to a length of about 2.5″. The head is accentuated by a beard and moustache, which adds to the dog’s bold and alert expression.	The Bouvier des Flandres served farmers and cattle merchants in guiding cattle in the great farmlands of southwest Flanders and on the French northern plain. In fact, bouvier means cowherd or oxherd in French, although the dogs were formerly more often called Vuilbaard (dirty beard) or koe hond (cow dog). Besides their main duty as a cattle drover, the Bouvier was an all around farm dog, functioning also as a protector of the house and farm.As expected from a dog selected to perform a variety of tasks, these working dogs were of a variety of types, colors, and even sizes. This wide variety also reflected the fact that this was a working dog, and they were chosen by ability, not pedigree or aesthetics. The derivation of the breed is not documented but may have included mastiff, sheepdog, and possibly even spaniel breeds. The first breed standard, drawn up in 1912, reflected this diversity of types and signaled a growing interest in the breed.In the midst of their rising popularity, most of the Bouviers were lost in World War I—although some Bouviers served as ambulance and messenger dogs during the war. One of the few survivors was of such superior quality that the breed was successfully revived through his progeny. This dog, Champion Nic de Sottegem, can be found in virtually every modern Bouvier pedigree. In 1922, a revised standard further defined the desirable Bouvier type, and helped pave the way to a more homogeneous breed. When the first Bouviers entered American show rings in 1931, they aroused much attention. The breed has never become extremely popular as a pet, but is popular at herding trials.	The Bouvier is loyal, devoted, fearless, and protective. Given daily exercise, they are calm and well-mannered indoors, but ready for an adventure in the great outdoors. They are independent and confident of their own judgment, yet willing to please. They can be domineering. They are reserved, even protective, toward strangers and should be introduced carefully to new dogs. They are very good with children, although may nip at heels in play. They are not excessive barkers or diggers.	The Bouvier des Flandres needs daily exercise and daily interaction, and a lot of both. They love the chance to herd, but their requirements can also be met with a good jog, a very long walk, or a vigorous play session. The harsh coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus scissoring and shaping (clipping for pets and stripping for show dogs) every three months.	69	90	24	28
42	Boxer	5	3	5	5	3	3	3	5	3	1	5	3	Working	Livestock dog, Mastiff, Bull	Germany	1800s	\N	The Boxer is exemplary in the combination of stylish elegance with strength and agility. This breed is square-proportioned with good substance and musculature. The Boxer’s stride is free and ground covering, with proud carriage. The head is distinctive, with a broad, blunt muzzle and alert expression. The coat is short and shiny. This dog is perfectly suited to serve as a working watchdog.	The Boxer derives from two central European breeds of dog that no longer exist: the larger Danziger Bullenbeiser and smaller Brabenter Bullenbeiser. Bullenbeiser means bull-biter, and these dogs were used to chase large game through the forest. This required a strong but agile dog with a broad powerful jaw and a recessed nose. In England, the Bulldog was the favored breed for the sport, whereas in Germany large mastiff-type dogs were used.Around the 1830s, German hunters began a concerted effort to create a new breed, crossing their Bullenbeisers with mastiff-type dogs for size, terriers for tenacity, and, finally, Bulldogs. The result was a tough agile dog with a streamlined body and strong grip. By 1895, an entirely new breed, the Boxer, had been established. Although the exact origin of the name Boxer is obscure, it may have been derived from the German Boxl. The Boxer was one of the first breeds to be employed as a police and military dog in Germany.By 1900, the breed had become established as a general utility dog, family pet, and even show dog. The AKC recognized the breed soon after, but only in the 1940s did the breed begin its steady rise to the top of the popularity charts, eventually peaking as the fourth most popular breed in America.	The Boxer is playful, exuberant, inquisitive, attentive, demonstrative, devoted, and outgoing; this dog is a perfect companion for an active family. Boxers can be stubborn, but are sensitive and responsive to commands. They may be assertive toward strange dogs, but are generally good with other family dogs and pets.	The Boxer needs daily mental and physical exertion. They likes to run, but their exercise needs can also be met with a good jog or long walk on leash. They do not do well in hot weather. Some snore. The coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	50	80	21	25
210	West Highland White Terrier Westie	4	3	3	5	3	3	4	1	4	4	3	4	Terrier	Terrier	Scotland	1800s	Poltalloch Terrier	The West Highland White Terrier is generally compact and short.  Their short legs aided in maneuverability in different types of terrain.  They have strong teeth and jaws. Their harsh double coat, especially the hard, straight outer coat, helped to provide protection from the elements. Their often have long tails.	The West Highland White Terrier shares their roots with the other terriers of Scotland, protecting homes and farms from fox, badger, and rodents. At one time the Westie, Skye, Cairn, and Scottish Terriers were all considered one breed with considerable diversity. Selective breeding based on such qualities as coat type or color likely produced the different breeds who would have easily remained distinct in the relative isolation of the various parts of the Scottish mainland and the western islands of the country.The Westie first gained attention in 1907 as the Poltalloch Terrier, named for the home of Col. E.D. Malcolm, who had been promoting the short-legged white terriers for many years. The breed has gone under several different names, including Roseneath, Poltalloch, White Scottish, Little Skye, and Cairn. In fact, the AKC first registered them as the Roseneath Terrier in 1908, but the name was changed to West Highland White Terrier in 1909. Since that date they have made quite a name for themselves, being established as one of the most popular terriers in the home.	The busy Westie is often happy, curious, and always in the thick of things. They can be affectionate and demanding, one of the friendliest terriers. They are not friendly, however, toward small pets. They enjoy a daily walk or playtime in the yard, as well as playtime at home. They are independent and somewhat stubborn. They can be vocal and can dig.	The West Highland White Terrier often enjoys the outdoors and are a well mannered member of the household, if taken for regular exercise. They need either a short to moderate walk on leash or a good game in the yard every day. Their wire coat needs combing two or three times weekly, and potentially professional grooming every three months. In some areas, it may be difficult to keep their coat white.	30	40	17	17
43	Boykin Spaniel	4	3	4	4	4	4	5	1	4	3	3	3	Sporting	Spaniel	United States	1900s	\N	The Boykin Spaniel is a medium-sized dog built to flush and retrieve over all types of ground conditions with agility and reasonable speed. This breed has strong, but not overly heavy, bone and is slightly longer than tall. The jaws are long and strong. The coat has a medium length outer coat that can range from flat to slightly wavy, which protects from the elements and repels water; and a short, dense undercoat for insulation. Movement is effortless with good reach and strong drive.	In the early 1900s, hunters on South Carolina’s Wateree River used section boats, which were large boats that broke into smaller boats. They needed a small retrieving dog that could fit into these tiny sectionboats that could only fit one man and one small dog. L.W. “Whit” Boykin and his relatives tried several crosses to produce such a dog, finally hitting upon success with a small brown stray spaniel found by a friend in Spartanburg, South Carolina around 1905. The dog, named Dumpy, developed into an adept turkey dog and waterfowl retriever. Dumpy was bred to another stray brown spaniel, and eventually crosses were made with the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, and American Water Spaniel.These dogs became known for their versatility, retaining the flushing abilities of a spaniel and adding water retrieving and driving and tracking. The breed does not point, but flushes. They have excellent stamina and can hunt upland game even in hot weather. Their forte, however, remains waterfowl, where they have been called “the dog who doesn’t rock the boat.”The breed’s nexus was around Camden, South Carolina, where many hunters and wealthy families wintered. These families often left in the spring with little brown spaniels, distributing the Boykin around the country but especially along the eastern seaboard. The Boykin Spaniel Society was formed in 1977 and now has worldwide membership. In 1985, the Boykin Spaniel became the state dog of South Carolina, and in that same year it was recognized by the UKC. It joined the AKC Sporting Group in 2010. The Boykin Spaniel is more popular than the AKC registration numbers would indicate, and is traditionally a dog used for companionship in the southeastern United States.	The Boykin is a friend to all, happy and eager to join any adventure—especially if it involves hiking, swimming, or traipsing through the woods. They are eager to please and relatively easy to train, fine for novice owners. They get along well with other dogs and pets. They don’t bark excessively and are well-behaved house dogs as long as they get enough exercise.	Boykins need a fairly high level of activity. A long walk or jogging venture, along with games of fetch, will usually satisfy their exercise needs each day. They also enjoy swimming. The coat is somewhat oily so requires weekly brushing and occasional bathing. Ears should be checked regularly.	25	40	14	18
44	Briard	3	4	3	3	1	3	1	5	1	4	4	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	France	1300s	Berger de Brie	The Briard is square or slightly longer than tall and powerful without being course; the overall appearance is one of handsome form. The Briard is a boundary herder, acting as a “moving fence” to keep a flock in an unfenced area. This requires the dog to be an independent thinker. Briards are loose-eyed, upright herders. Their movement has been described as “quicksilver,” with supple, light strides that give the impression of gliding. Their undercoat is fine and tight, and their outer coat is coarse and dry, lying flat in long, slightly wavy locks. On the shoulders, the coat’s length is 6 inches or more. The questioning confident expression is enhanced by the longer eyebrows, as well as the long-appearing head.	The Briard is one of four French sheepdog breeds, the others being the Beauceron, Picardy, and Pyrenean. This is the oldest of the four breeds, with dogs resembling Briards depicted in art from as long ago as the eighth century, and more definitive evidence by the fourteenth century. These early dogs were known as Chien Berger de Brie (Shepherd Dog of Brie), giving rise to the belief that the breed originated in the province of Brie; however, it may also be a corruption of Chien d’Aubry, referring to the dog of Aubry de Montdidier that avenged his master’s murder (according to fourteenth-century legend). The name Briard was not used until 1809.Originally employed as a herd protector, the Briard was expected to tackle predators if the need arose. Briards also protected the flock and estates against human intruders. After the French Revolution, which resulted in the land being divided into smaller sectors, it was important that the flocks be kept close to home, and the Briards turned their talents to herding, rather than guarding sheep.The first breed standard was written in 1897, but it was replaced by another in 1909. Briards came to America very early, with evidence that both Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson brought some of the first specimens to the New World. These dogs did not have a lasting influence, however.The Briard was the official dog of the French army in World War II. After World War I, American soldiers brought some Briards to America, and this was the beginning of the modern American Briard. Popularity of the breed has been modest in America, but these dogs remain the most popular sheepherders in their native France.	Devoted and faithful, the Briard is a loving and protective companion. Briards are independent, intelligent, and self-assured, but are also willing to please and eager to serve as a partner in adventure. They are reserved with strangers. They can be assertive with other dogs and may nip at people’s heels when playing. They tend to stay at home and may attempt to keep the family’s children home as well! Young Briards need a lot of socialization.	This is a dog that needs a good amount of activity and interaction every day. Their favorite exercise is the chance to herd, but they can also be satisfied with a long walk or jog, or a long play session coupled with a little training. Their long coat needs brushing or combing every other day or mats can form.	50	100	22	27
45	Brittany Spaniel	4	5	4	5	3	3	5	1	4	1	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Setter, Pointer, Versatile hunting dog	France	1800s	Epagneul Breton	The leggiest of the Sporting breeds, the Brittany is square-proportioned, the height at the shoulder equaling the length of the body. This breed stands slightly higher at the withers than at the rump, and is medium-sized with light bone. The combination of long legs and light bones endows the Brittany with remarkable agility and speed. In fact, the breed is very quick and is noted for ground-covering side movement at the trot. The Brittany may be born tailless. The breed’s coat is far less profuse than that of spaniels and is either flat or wavy. An overly profuse coat is detrimental in briars and is considered a severe fault. The Brittany’s expression is alert and eager, but soft. The eyes are protected from briars by a fairly heavy eyebrow. The Brittany is an extremely athletic, eager dog that should be ready and able to run for extended periods.	In the mid 1800s, French sportsmen crossed their small land spaniels with English Setters in attempts to produce a dog better suited for their needs. Some of the offspring were tailless, and their descendants continued to be tailless or stub-tailed. More importantly, they were excellent hunters with strong noses. These dogs soon became popular not only with the French gentry but also with poachers because they would both point and retrieve and were extremely obedient—essential qualities for the clandestine activities of the poachers.The first Brittany (or “Epagneul Breton”) was registered in France in 1907. The Brittany came to America (Mexico) around 1925. The breed took a while to be accepted, mostly because hunters expected a pointing dog to have a long tail. When the dogs were given a chance, however, they proved their mettle and have since become the most popular of all pointing breeds at field trials. In fact, registrations eventually soared to place the Brittany among the top 20 in popularity, no doubt because of this dog’s abilities, close-ranging hunting style, small size, and tractable nature. Although registered as the Brittany Spaniel with the AKC from 1934, the word spaniel was dropped in 1982 in recognition of the dog’s hunting style, which is more like that of a setter than a spaniel.	The Brittany is quick and curious, always on the lookout for birds or fun. These dogs love to run, scout, hunt, and play. They have an independent nature, befitting any pointing breed, yet are sensitive and very responsive to human direction. Brittanys make good pets as long as they receive daily mental and physical exercise. If not given sufficient exercise, they can become destructive.	The Brittany is generally a hardy dog that requires little maintenance. This breed’s major requirement is for abundant exercise, at least an hour of exertion—not just walking—every day. The coat is not particularly thick or long, but does require brushing once or twice weekly.	30	40	18	21
46	Brussels Griffon	4	2	4	4	3	3	2	1	3	4	5	5	Toy	Pinscher	Belgium	1800s	Griffon Beige, Friffon Bruxellois, Belgian Griffon	The Brussels Griffon is square-proportioned, thickset, and compact. This breed has good bone for its size. This dog’s movement is a purposeful trot, with moderate reach and drive. In temperament, Brussels Griffons are full of self-importance, and their carriage reflects this attitude. Their almost human expression attracts attention and admirers. Their coat can be rough, with hard wiry hair, which is longer around the head; or smooth, with a short glossy coat.	A product of Belgium, the Brussels Griffon’s forebears were probably the Affenpinscher and a Belgian street dog, the Griffon d’Ecurie (Stable Griffon). The breed gained favor as a guard of cabs in Brussels, where their cocky but comic demeanor was probably more effective at attracting riders than dissuading robbers. In the late 1800s, this mixture was then crossed with the Pug, at that time extremely popular in neighboring Holland. The Pug mixes account for the brachycephalic head type and for the smooth-coated individuals of the breed, known then (and still in some countries) as the Petit Brabancon. The smooths were not initially accepted, since griffon means wiry.By 1880, the breed was sufficiently established to be recognized at Belgian dog shows. Around this same time there is some suggestion that additional mixes were made with the Yorkshire Terrier and English Toy Spaniel, the latter further contributing to the Brussels Griffon’s head configuration. By the early 1900s, the little street urchin had risen to the heights of popularity in Belgium and found itself in great demand by nobility. Although the breed’s numbers were decimated by World War I, the breed recovered and has since gained ardent admirers around the world.In some countries, only the red rough-coated dogs are classified as the Brussels Griffon; black rough-coated dogs are known as the Belgian Griffon; and smooth-coated dogs are known as the Petit Brabancon.	The spunky Brussels Griffon is full of himself, brimming with self-confidence and gusto. These dogs are bold, playful, stubborn, and mischievous. They are usually good with other dogs and pets. They tend to bark and climb, and some can be escape artists. Brussels Griffons make saucy companions for a family wanting an entertaining, sensitive pet. However, sensitivity and size make them a poor choice for families with young children. They can be difficult to housetrain and may suffer from separation anxiety.	The Brussels Griffon is an active breed, always on the lookout for action. They need daily mental and physical stimulation, but their small size makes such stimulation possible with a robust indoor game. They also enjoy a short walk on leash. The rough coat needs combing two or three times weekly, plus professional grooming every three months. Grooming for the smooth coat is minimal, consisting only of occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	8	10	9	11
47	Bull Terrier	4	3	5	3	1	3	3	4	1	1	3	5	Terrier	Terrier, Mastiff, Bull	England	1800s	English Bull Terrier	The Bull Terrier is the cavalier gladiator— a good looking tough character. This breed is strongly built and muscular, longer than tall. These dogs’ muscle mass combined with their relatively low center of gravity make them sturdy and stable. Their distinctive head not only shows off their keen and determined expression, but also their great jaw strength. Their gait is smooth and easy. The skin is tight, and the coat short, flat, and harsh.	Around 1835, a mix between a Bulldog and the old English Terrier produced a dog known as the Bull and Terrier. A later mix to the Spanish Pointer added needed size, and the result was a tenacious, strong, yet agile dog.Around 1860 James Hinks mixed the Bull and Terrier with the White English Terrier and the Dalmatian, producing an all-white strain he called Bull Terriers. The new all white strain immediately captured the attention of the public; they became a fashionable companion for young gentlemen who wanted a good-looking masculine dog at their sides. The dogs gained the reputation for defending themselves, but not provoking a fight, and were thus dubbed “the white cavalier.”The dogs gradually became more streamlined, and the Bull Terrier’s distinctive head evolved. Around 1900, mixes with Staffordshire Bull Terriers reintroduced color into the breed. This mix was not well accepted at first, but finally gained equal status as a separate AKC variety in 1936. The white variety still continues as the more popular variety, but both colors have enjoyed great popularity as pets. Their comical nature and expression wins them many friends, and they have proven to be very successful in movies and advertising.	Exuberant, comical, playful, assertive, and very mischievous describes the Bull Terrier. These dogs are an imaginative breed that often sees things their own way and are stubborn to the end. For all their tough bravado, this is an extremely sweet-natured, affectionate, and devoted breed, but should be introduced carefully to other dogs and small animals. They are prone to compulsive behaviors such as tail-chasing or dot staring.	The Bull Terrier needs to be entertained, either with a good exercise session or mental stimulation every day—preferably both. This is an active breed that enjoys a good run, but it is best to run the Bull Terrier only in a safe area. Coat care is minimal.	50	70	21	22
48	English Bulldog	1	1	4	5	1	4	4	2	2	2	5	1	Non-sporting	Mastiff, Bull	England	Early 1200s	\N	The Bulldog’s heavy, thick-set, low-slung body with wide shoulders gives it a low center of gravity. The massive head, of which the circumference should equal at least the height of the dog at the shoulder, gives ample room for muscular attachment for the strong, wide jaws. The limbs are sturdy, the gait loose-jointed, shuffling, and rolling—this is not a breed that needs to run! The coat is fine and glossy.	With the most distinctive mug in dogdom, the Bulldog has an equally distinctive history. The Bulldog’s origin lies in the cruel sport of bull baiting, which originated in England around the thirteenth century. The dog’s purpose was to attack and madden the bull by grabbing it, usually by the nose, and not releasing its grip. Not only was this considered entertainment, but it also was believed that a bull’s meat was tastier if the bull was baited before being butchered.Some Bulldogs were also set against bears for bear baiting, purely for entertainment. Bulldog owners set great store by their dog’s ferocity and, especially, fortitude in the face of pain—so much so that horrifying stories exist of owners proving their dog’s toughness by demonstrating that it would hang onto the bull despite being tortured or mutilated by the owner.In 1835, bull baiting was outlawed, and a new phase began for the Bulldog. Some efforts were made to have the dogs fight one another, but this was clearly not the Bulldog’s forte. Now a dog without a cause, the breed’s popularity plummeted. By all rights, the breed should have become extinct, except that it had gained so many ardent admirers that they set out to rescue the Bulldog by selecting against ferocity while still maintaining—and often accentuating—its distinctive physical characteristics. So successful were they that the Bulldog became an extremely amiable character, with a personality not at all like its “sourmug” might suggest. Its tough steadfast persona led it to be identified as a national symbol of England. Its amiable clownish personality belies its appearance, and the Bulldog is a popular pet.	Despite its “sourmug,” the Bulldog is jovial, comical, and amiable, among the most docile and mellow of dogs. He is willing to please, although he retains a stubborn streak. He is very good with children. Most are moderately friendly toward strangers. Although some can be aggressive with strange dogs, the breed is quite good with other pets.	The Bulldog appreciates a daily outing but cannot tolerate hot humid weather, which can be deadly. He should not be expected to jog or walk great distances, or to jump from any heights. Most Bulldogs cannot swim. Most Bulldogs wheeze and snore, and some drool. Coat care is minimal, but facial wrinkles (and any folds around the tail) should be cleaned daily.	110	130	24	27
49	Bullmastiff	1	2	1	3	2	4	1	5	1	1	5	5	Working	Mastiff, Bull	England	1800s	\N	This nearly square breed is powerful and active, a combination of strength, endurance, and alertness. The Bullmastiff appears to be 60 percent Mastiff and 40 percent Bulldog. This dog’s gait is smooth and powerful, but the angulation is moderate. The coat is short and dense, and the expression keen and alert.	Although the Mastiff is one of Britain’s oldest breeds, its immediate descendant, the Bullmastiff, is probably a fairly recent development. It is true that occasional references to the Bullmastiff, or mixes of the Mastiff and Bulldog, can be found as early as 1791; however, no evidence exists that these strains continued.The documented history of the Bullmastiff begins near the end of the nineteenth century, when poaching game from the large estates had become such a problem that the gamekeepers’ lives were endangered. They needed a tough courageous dog that could wait silently, but the Mastiff was not fast enough, and the Bulldog was not large enough. The breeds were mixed in an attempt to create their perfect dog; the aptly named “Gamekeeper’s Night Dog.” The preferred color was dark brindle, as it faded into the night. As the breed’s reputation grew, however, many estate owners chose the dogs as estate sentries and preferred the lighter fawns, especially those with black masks, a coloration reminiscent of their Mastiff ancestry.The ideal Bullmastiff ultimately appeared to be 60 percent Mastiff and 40 percent Bulldog. By 1924, the breed was deemed to be pure and was recognized by the English Kennel Club. AKC recognition followed in 1933.	The Bullmastiff is gentle and quiet, a devoted companion and guardian. This dog is not easily roused, but once threatened it is fearless. Bullmastiffs are stubborn and cannot easily be goaded into action against their will. Some can be assertive towards new dogs, and should be introduced carefully. Males especially tend to not tolerate other males. They are good with children, but should be raised with them. The Bullmastiff needs a firm but loving home. This breed is not for fragile or timid owners.	The Bullmastiff is a big dog and needs daily exercise to stay in shape. Their needs are moderate, however, and can be met with walks on leash and short romps. They do not do well in hot, humid weather, and need a soft bed and plenty of room to stretch out. They drool; some snore. Coat care is minimal.	13	14	10	10
50	Cairn Terrier	4	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	3	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	Scotland	Middle Ages	\N	This is a working terrier, and is hardy, game, and active. Cairn Terriers are short-legged, and longer than tall, but not as low to the ground as the Sealyham or Scottish Terriers. Their build enables them to fit into close quarters in pursuit of their quarry. Their head is shorter and wider than any other terrier, giving them good jaw strength. The weather-resistant coat consists of a soft, close undercoat and a profuse, harsh outer coat. Furnishing around the face adds to its somewhat foxy expression.	One of a family of short-legged terriers developed on the Scottish Isle of Skye, the Cairn Terrier probably still resembles the ancestral form to a greater degree than others descended from the same origins. These dogs seem to have existed since the fifteenth century and were used to hunt fox, badger, and otter. The dogs were adept at bolting otters from the cairns (piles of stone that served as landmarks or memorials).The dogs came in a variety of colors, ranging from white to gray to red, and were all considered Scotch Terriers when they began to enter the show ring. In 1873, they were divided into Dandie Dinmont and Skye Terriers, with the Cairn in the latter group. This group was later again divided into Skye and Hard-haired Terriers in 1881, and the Hard-haired Terriers eventually separated into Scotch, West Highland White, and the breed eventually known as the Cairn. At one time, the Cairn was called the Short-haired Skye, then the Cairn Terrier or Skye, and finally, around 1912, the Cairn Terrier.Some of the most influential early Cairns were all white, but white, as well as mixing with West Highland Whites, was banned by the 1920s. The breed became quite popular in England, and fairly popular in America, gaining its greatest fame as the dog playing Toto in the Wizard of Oz. As one of the more natural and less sculpted terriers, the breed is highly regarded by those who appreciate a working terrier. Perhaps the motto of the British breed club sums it up best: “The best little pal in the world.”	The Cairn is the essence of terrier; plucky, spirited, bold, inquisitive, hardy, clever, stubborn, and scrappy. Cairns are responsive to their family’s wishes, however, and try to please; in fact, they are surprisingly sensitive. These dogs can be good pets as long as they are given daily physical and mental exercise in a safe area. They enjoy playing with children, but can be assertive with other dogs and chases small animals, so introduce carefully. They love to sniff, explore, and hunt. They dig; some bark.	Despite their small size, Cairns need outdoor exercise every day, either a moderate walk on leash, a fun game in the yard, or an excursion in a safe area. Their wire coat needs combing once weekly, plus professional grooming at least twice yearly.	35	55	19	24
51	Canaan Dog	3	4	3	3	3	4	2	3	4	1	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding, Primitive	Israel	Ancient times	Kalef K’naani, Kelev Cana’ani	The Canaan Dog resembles none of the other herding breeds, arising from a completely different background. Nonetheless, this breed shares similar traits needed in any dog that must herd for hours. Canaans are medium-sized, square-proportioned dogs of moderate substance that combines strength, agility, and endurance. They are not exaggerated in any way. Their movement is athletic and graceful, with a brisk, ground-covering trot. They are able to change directions instantly. They have a double coat, with a short, soft undercoat that varies in density according to climate, and a straight, flat-lying, harsh outer coat, with a slight ruff. This breed can adapt to great extremes in weather ranging from hot days to cold nights.	Canaan Dogs have evolved through hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of years of hardship. It is thought that the breed originated in the biblical land of Canaan and were known as Kelev Kanani (Dog of Canaan). When the Israelites were dispersed from their homeland by the Romans 2000 years ago, most of the Israeli dogs were left to fend for themselves in the Sebulon Coastal Plain and Negev Desert. Bedouins captured male puppies from the wild to raise as guard and livestock dogs.When the Israeli Defense Force tried to develop service dogs in the 1930s, the traditional European service breeds weren’t able to adapt to the harsh climate. The Canaan Dog’s existence is primarily owed to the efforts of one woman, Dr. Rudolphina Menzel. Her search for a more suitable military dog led her to the native feral dogs. Several dogs were captured, and a breeding and training program was begun. The dogs quickly proved their worth, serving as sentry dogs, messengers, mine detectors, Red Cross helpers, and even locators of wounded soldiers during the Second World War. They were trained as guide dogs for the blind in the 1950s but were too small and independent to be widely successful. Perhaps no other breed of dog has ever risen from feral roots to become such a useful and dedicated companion in so short a time.The first Canaan Dog came to America in 1965. Not the flashiest of breeds, Canaans’ understated good looks may have made many people overlook them, despite their companionship credentials. Nonetheless, they slowly attracted admirers, and the AKC finally admitted them into the Herding Group in 1997. The breed has remained obscure despite its attractive attributes.	Not only do Canaan Dogs excel as herders, but they have also proven themselves in a variety of tasks involving dependability and obedience. This is an intelligent, devoted, docile dog that is quite tractable and willing and quick to please. They are aloof toward strangers and protective of their family. The Canaan Dog is generally good with other pets and dogs, but may need to be introduced to new dogs carefully. This breed is a natural guardian and some tend to bark a lot.	Few breeds can claim as pure a working heritage as the Canaan Dog. This dog will not be happy just sitting around. The Canaan needs lots of exercise and mental and physical challenges. These needs can be met with herding exercise, a long jog, a strenuous game session along with a challenging training session. The coat needs brushing about once a week to remove dead hairs.	90	130	24	28
52	Cane Corso	3	3	2	4	2	2	2	5	3	1	3	5	Working	Mastiff	Italy	Middle Ages	Italian Mastiff	The Cane Corso is a medium to large size mastiff-like dog—sturdy, muscular, largeboned, and athletic. This breed is strong and agile, and is neither overly bulky nor racy. This dog longer than tall. The gait is effortless and powerful. The coat is short, stiff, and dense. The Cane Corso projects confidence and power, a capable protector of property and family.	The Cane Corso is the more streamlined of the two Italian breeds descending from the ancient Roman molossian war dogs, the heavier version being the Neapolitan Mastiff. While the Neo evolved as a dedicated guard dog, the Corso became a versatile farm dog.Cane Corso (pronounced KAHN-nay Corso) comes from the word for catch dog, a dog used to overpower large prey. The name was used to describe these dogs as early as the twelfth century. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Corsos were used to protect farms, hunt tough prey, and even guided and rounded up sheep, goats, and semi-wild cattle.With the onset of modern times, jobs for Corsos declined; then after World War I and especially World War II the Corso population in southern Italy dwindled. By the 1970s, only a few Corsos remained with peasants spread throughout the countryside. In 1973, two individuals located, collected, and bred the the remaining Corsos, and a decade later a breed club was formed. By 1996, the Cane Corso was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The first Corsos were brought to the United States in 1988. The AKC granted the breed full recognition in 2010.	Cane Corsos are utterly devoted to their family and tend to stick close to them at all times. They are eager to please and fairly easy to train, but because some can be domineering, they are not a breed for a novice owner. They are suspicious of strangers and if not extensively socialized can be overly cautious or assertive. Most, but not all, get along well with dogs of the opposite sex and with other animals. However, they are not a good candidate for dog parks.	Corsos tend to be quiet indoors but do need a moderate amount of exercise daily. A long jog or a couple of high-energy play sessions such as tugging, fetching, or swimming are fine. This is not a good breed for dog parks. They thrive on mental stimulation, and they especially enjoy herding and other dog sports that combine mental and physical challenges. Coat care is minimal.	25	38	11	13
53	Cardigan Welsh Corgi	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	4	4	1	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Wales	Ancient times	\N	The Cardigan is a low-set dog, approximately 1.8 times longer than it is tall, with moderately heavy bone. They are small but powerful dogs capable of the agility, speed, and endurance necessary to drive cattle for extended periods. Their small size allowed them to duck under the cattle’s hooves should they kick at the dog. Their gait is free, smooth, effortless, and ground covering. Their double coat consists of a soft thick undercoat and slightly harsh outer coat of medium length. Their expression is alert, gentle, and watchful, yet friendly.	One of the earliest breeds to come to the British Isles, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi was brought from central Europe to Cardiganshire, South Wales centuries ago. Its derivation is unknown, though it may have been influenced by the extinct English turn-spit dog, a short-legged, low-bodied dog used to turn spits in kitchens.Initially used as a family protector and even helper in the hunt, it was only later that the Corgi found its true forte. In a time when the land available to tenant farmers was determined by how much acreage their cattle occupied, it was to the farmer’s advantage to have scattered, far-ranging stock. Thus, a dog that would drive, rather than herd, the cattle was an invaluable aid, and the Corgi stepped right into this role, nipping at the cattle’s heels and ducking their kicks. In fact the word Corgi probably is derived from Cor (to gather) and Gi (dog).The original Corgis were supposed to measure a Welsh yard (slightly longer than an English yard) from nose to tail-tip, and in parts of Cardiganshire the breed was called the yard-long Dog or Ci-llathed. When the Crown lands were later divided, sold, and fenced, the need for drovers was lost, and the Corgi lost its job. Kept by some as a guard and companion, nonetheless, it became a luxury that few could afford, and it became perilously close to extinction.Crosses with other breeds had been tried, but most were not particularly successful. The exception was the cross with the brindle herder, and present-day Cardigans are the products of this slight herder influence. The first Cardigans were shown around 1925. Until 1934, the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis were considered one breed, and interbreeding between the two was common. The first Cardigans came to America in 1931, and AKC recognized the breed in 1935. For some unknown reason, the Cardigan has never enjoyed the popularity of the Pembroke Corgi, and remains only modestly popular.	Fun-loving and high spirited, yet easygoing, the Cardigan is a devoted and amusing companion. This is a hardy breed, capable of a day dodging kicks, so they are agile and tireless. At home he is well mannered, but he is inclined to bark. He tends to be reserved with strangers and can be scrappy with other dogs.	The Cardigan needs a surprising amount of exercise for his size. The Cardigan’s needs can best be met with a herding session, but a moderate walk or vigorous play session will also suffice. The coat needs brushing once a week to remove dead hair.	30	44	17	20
54	Carolina Dog	2	2	3	2	3	3	2	4	4	1	2	2	Sighthound	Sighthound & Pariah (UKC)	North America	Unknown	\N	The Carolina Dog is a medium- to large-size sighthound with the distinctive appearance of a small jackal or coyote, suggesting the breed’s pack mentality, resourcefulness and ability to adapt for survival from its early days of free-living conditions in the savannah and swampy forest habitats of the southern United States. The Carolina Dog is easily recognized by his pointed ears, foxlike face and curved fishhook tail.	A nod to the breed’s pack mentality, the Carolina Dog descended from a group of primitive dogs that migrated with the first primitive humans across the Bering land bridge from Asia into North America. The dogs’ remains were found near other relics from the Southwest Indians, and from there, they moved into Central and South America, as well as the eastern United States. Studies of free-ranging dogs from the Southeast have revealed these primitive dogs’ continued existence. Their appearance, not to mention behavior, further imply a close ancestry with, or decent from, these primitive dogs. Named the Carolina Dog, and also commonly called the American Dingo, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1995.	The Carolina Dog is active, healthy and intelligent. Although shy and suspicious by nature, the loyal, independent and alert Carolina Dog is warm and affectionate toward his human family.	The Carolina Dog has a short- to medium-length coat that sheds seasonally, but because he grooms himself much like a cat, grooming needs don’t extend much past the occasional bath, brushing and nail trimming. The Carolina Dog isn’t a high-energy breed by any means, but still should receive regular exercise, such as playtime in a fenced yard or being taken on a couple of walks a day. Easily trainable and eager to please, he enjoys activities such as hunting, swimming, hiking, retrieving balls and catching flying discs, and excels in dog sports such as agility, obedience and rally.	99	170	23	30
55	Caucasian Shepherd Dog	2	2	3	4	2	3	2	5	2	3	1	3	Mastiff	Guardian (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Eastern Europe	Unknown	Caucasian Ovcharka, Caucasian Mountain Dog	Well known as a guardian and watchdog, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is powerful and athletic, with solid muscling and heavy boning. He has a large wedge-shaped head and thick curved tail that may be carried over his back. The breed is often recognized by his dark facial mask against a thick coat that’s shades of gray, fawn or red with white markings.	The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is an ancient breed originating in Eastern Europe’s Kavkaz, or Caucasus, mountain range, where he was used for guarding and protecting herds, flocks and villages from predators and trespassers. The breed is well-connected to similar breeds of the region, with studies suggesting the Caucasian Shepherd Dog as a close relative of the sheepdogs of the Balkans and the mastiffs of Asia. Beginning in the 1920s, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog was selectively bred for his prized qualities of power, confidence, courage, endurance and acute hearing and sight. The breed has been recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of its Guardian Dog Group since 1995 and by the American Kennel Club as part of its Foundation Stock Service since 1996.	Courageous, spirited and strong-willed, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is quick to defend his people and property. He is defensive and territorial toward strangers and other dogs, yet gentle and kind with his human family. Steady and even-keeled, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog requires proper socialization and patient training to avoid any potential aggression.	The Caucasian Shepherd Dog’s thick double coat can be short to very long. Those with the longer coat should be groomed daily, while shorter coats should be brushed weekly. Additionally, his nails should be trimmed, ears cleaned and teeth brushed regularly. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a calm breed with relatively low energy, but enjoys daily walks or playtime outdoors and has plenty of endurance to sustain extended walks or hikes. On-leash walks and free play in a large fenced yard are best for this intelligent and independent breed. Although active outdoors, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is quiet and still in the house.	13	18	12	13
56	Cavalier King Charles Spaniel	3	3	4	5	5	5	5	1	4	3	4	3	Toy	Spaniel	England	1600s	\N	The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is an elegant, royal, toy spaniel, slightly longer than tall, with moderate bones. The Cav retains the build of a working spaniel, yet in a smaller version. Their gait is free and elegant, with good reach and drive. Their silky coat is of moderate length, with a slight wave permissible. Long feathering on the feet is a breed characteristic. A hallmark of the breed is its gentle, sweet, melting expression.	As its name implies, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is derived from spaniel roots. The European toy dogs were probably the result of breeding small spaniels to Oriental toy breeds such as the Japanese Chin and perhaps the Tibetan Spaniel. These Tudor lapdogs, known as “comforter spaniels,” served as lap and foot warmers, and even surrogate hot water bottles. In addition, they served the vital function of attracting fleas from their owners’ bodies! The toy spaniels became especially popular because they appealed to all members of the family.In the 1700s, King Charles II was so enamored with his toy spaniels that he was accused of ignoring matters of state in favor of his dogs. The dogs were so closely associated with him that they became known as King Charles Spaniels. After his death, the Duke of Marlborough took over as the major advocate of the breed; the red and white “Blenheim” color, which was his favorite, is named after his estate. The King Charles Spaniel continued to grace the homes of the wealthy for generations, but with time a shorter-nosed dog was preferred.By the early 1900s, the few dogs that resembled the early members of the breed were considered to be inferior. A twist of fate occurred when a wealthy American, Roswell Eldridge, came to England and offered outlandish prize money for the best “pointed-nosed” spaniels, most resembling the old type. Breeders bred their old-type dogs together in an effort to gain the prize, and in so doing, many came to appreciate the old type. Ironically, these dogs, named Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in honor of the Cavalier King, eventually outstripped their short-nosed counterparts in popularity, becoming one of the most popular breeds in England. They were slower to catch on in America, and many Cavalier owners fought AKC recognition in an effort to control the problems that so often accompany popularity. In 1996, the AKC recognized the Cavalier. Its popularity continues to grow.	The Cavalier in many ways fits the bill as an ideal house pet. He is sweet, gentle, playful, willing to please, affectionate, and quiet. He equally enjoys sharing time on the couch or on a walk. He neither digs nor barks excessively. He is amiable toward other dogs, pets, and strangers. Outdoors, his spaniel heritage kicks in, and he loves to explore, sniff, and chase.	The Cavalier needs a fair amount of exercise every day, either in the form of a moderate walk on leash or a romp in a safe area. His long coat needs brushing every other day.	55	80	21	26
182	Shetland Sheepdog Sheltie	3	3	3	3	4	4	1	1	5	4	3	5	Herding	Herding	Scotland (Shetland Island)	1800s	Sheltie	The Shetland Sheepdog is a small, agile dog, longer than they are tall. Their gait is smooth, effortless, and ground covering, imparting good agility, speed, and endurance essential in a herding dog. They have a double coat, with a short, dense undercoat and a long, straight, harsh outer coat.  Their expression is is often gentle, intelligent, and questioning. Although they can resemble a Rough Collie in miniature, subtle differences distinguish the two breeds.	The ancestors of the Shetland Sheepdog were the herding dogs of Scotland that also provided the basis for the Collie and Border Collie. Some of these dogs were quite small, measuring only about 18 inches in height. The Shetland Sheepdog almost certainly is derived from these early Collie type dogs, which then were further developed on the Shetland Islands. Some Iceland dogs may have also played a role, and perhaps even a black and tan King Charles Spaniel.The scarcity of vegetation favored smaller animals, and the dogs needed to herd them were proportionately smaller. In a land with few fences, an adept herder was essential to keep livestock away from cultivated land. As an all-around farm dog, they herded not only sheep but also ponies and chickens. In some remote areas, it was customary to keep all animals in the family’s home building during winter, and an amiable herding dog no doubt worked their way right into the family part of the home.The British naval fleet used to frequent the islands for maneuvers, and often bought puppies to take home to England. Early dogs were referred to as Toonie dogs (Toon being the local Shetland word for farm), but they later became known as Shetland Collies. Collie enthusiasts objected to the name, so it was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. Dogs of this breed are far more often referred to by their nickname of “Sheltie,” however. Following the immense popularity of the Collie, the Sheltie became the answer to the family wanting a loyal, striking pet of smaller size, and they are one of the most popular breeds in the world.	The Shetland Sheepdog is often extremely bright, extremely sensitive, and extremely willing to please. This combination makes for a dog that can be very amenable, quick to learn, and devoted to their family. They are not only gentle, playful, amiable, and companionable, but also can usually get along well with children, although they may nip at heels in play. They can be reserved and often timid toward strangers. They tend to bark a lot.	The Sheltie is energetic, but their exercise needs can be met with a good walk, short jog, or active game and training session. Their thick coat needs brushing or combing every other day.	45	60	18	20
57	Chesapeake Bay Retriever	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	United States	1800s	\N	The Chesapeake Bay Retriever was developed to hunt waterfowl under adverse conditions, facing strong tides in rough water, high winds, and sometimes even having to break through ice. They are extraordinary swimmers, with a strong, yet tender, bite enabling them to carry birds. They have powerful limbs and webbed feet. The Chessie is slightly longer than tall, with hindquarters as high, or higher, than its forequarters. The coat is rendered virtually waterproof by virtue of their oily, harsh outer coat and dense wooly undercoat. The color matches its working surroundings: any shade of brown, sedge, or dead grass.	The history of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is one of the most fascinating— and fortunate—in dogdom. In 1807, an American ship rescued the crew and cargo from a shipwrecked English brig off the coast of Maryland. Among the rescued were two presumably Newfoundland pups that were given to the rescuers. These pups (one black and one red) later proved to be skilled water retrievers, and as their reputations grew, many local retrievers of uncertain background came to be bred to them.It is also thought that Irish Water Spaniel, Newfoundland, Bloodhound, and other local hound crosses added to the development of the breed. Gradually a distinct local breed emerged, a dog that would repeatedly swim through the rough icy waters of the Chesapeake Bay and unerringly retrieve duck after duck. By 1885, the breed was thoroughly established and recognized by the AKC. Despite being one of the oldest AKC recognized breeds, as well as one of the few breeds that can boast of being made in the United States, the Chessie’s popularity has remained modest.	The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is hardy enough to not only withstand, but also relish, repeated plunges into icy water. He loves to swim and retrieve. Despite an active life when outdoors, inside he tends to be calm. The Chessie tends to be independent, although he is eager to learn. He is reserved with strangers and can be protective; he also can be aggressive toward strange dogs if challenged. This is the hardiest, most strong-willed, and protective of the retriever breeds.	The Chessie is a large active dog that needs a daily chance to exercise. The oily, wavy coat needs weekly brushing but is generally easily maintained. The Chessie seldom needs washing; in fact, it’s hard to get a Chessie wet! Bathing destroys the coat’s oils and thus, its water resistance.	6	6	6	9
58	Chihuahua	5	1	2	2	1	3	1	1	2	2	2	5	Toy	Primative	Mexico	1500s	\N	The Chihuahua is graceful, small, and compact, slightly longer than he is tall. The Chihuahua has a saucy expression and alert, terrier-like attitude. The coat can be smooth, with soft, glossy hair, or long, with soft straight or wavy coats and fringed ears.	The smallest breed of dog, the Chihuahua has a controversial history. One theory holds that it originated in China and was brought to the New World by Spanish traders, where it was then crossed with small native dogs. The other theory contends that it originated entirely in Central and South America, descending from the native Techichi. A small red dog was believed to guide the soul to the underworld, and every Aztec family kept such a dog that was buried with any deceased family member. To make matters worse for the Techichi, the Toltecs and their conquerors, the Aztecs, often ate dogs and the Techichi may have sometimes been on the menu. Despite what may have been short lives, the Techichis apparently were well cared for during life by the priests or their families. In fact, the most likely origin of the Chihuahua is a combination of these theories: the native Techichi was probably crossed with tiny hairless Chinese dogs, but again the date when this occurred is controversial.The Chinese dogs may have been brought over when a land bridge spanned the Bering Strait, or they may have been brought later by Spanish traders. When Cortes conquered the Aztecs in the sixteenth century, the little dogs were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. About 300 years later, in 1850, three tiny dogs were found in Chihuahua, Mexico. A few were brought to the United States, but they aroused only moderate attention. Only when Xavier Cugat (“the rhumba king”) appeared in public with a Chihuahua as his constant companion did the breed capture the public’s hearts. It experienced a meteoric rise in popularity and has continued as one of America’s most popular breeds.	The saucy Chihuahua has earned his place as a favored toy dog because of his intense devotion to a single person. He is reserved with strangers but good with other household dogs and pets. Some try to be protective, but they are not very effective. Some may be quite bold; others may be timid. He may often  be temperamental. Some bark.	The Chihuahua is a lively dog that nonetheless can get his exercise running from room to room indoors. He enjoys exploring the yard or going for a short walk on leash and especially enjoys accompanying his owner on outings. He hates the cold and seeks out warmth. Coat care for the smooth is minimal. Care of the long coat entails brushing two to three times a week.	5	12	11	13
59	Chinese Crested Dog	3	1	4	4	3	5	5	1	3	4	2	4	Toy	Primative, Hairless	China	1200s	\N	The Chinese Crested is fine boned and slender, among the most elegant and graceful of breeds. In the Hairless variety, soft silky hair is found only on the head (crest), tail (plume), and feet and lower legs. The skin of the hairless areas is smooth and soft. In the Powderpuff the entire dog is covered with soft silky coat of moderate density and length.	The origins of the Chinese Crested are difficult to trace. Hairless dogs seem to arise by mutation all over the world, but they have been principally perpetuated in Central and South America. The Chinese Crested is the exception, apparently arising in Africa and brought to China as early as the thirteenth century. Chinese seafarers are said to have kept the dogs on ship as curios and to trade them with local merchants wherever they called. Thus, the breed was distributed to Turkey, Egypt, South Africa, and possibly Central and South America.Only in the 1800s were they recorded in Europe, with paintings and later, photographs, including dogs of Chinese Crested type. In the late 1800s, the breed found a proponent in the American Ida Garrett, who popularized several types of hairless dogs. With the help of a handful of committed breeders (including the famed Gypsy Rose Lee), the Chinese Crested gradually gained admirers in both America and Europe. In 1991—after a century of effort—the breed was recognized by the AKC.	The Chinese Crested is a combination of playful pixie, gentle lapdog, and sensitive companion. He is devoted to his family and willing to please; he is also good with other dogs, pets, and strangers. His demeanor should be gay and alert.	The Crested enjoys a romp outside, but he hates the cold. He is small enough that he can get sufficient exercise with vigorous inside games. Hairless varieties will need a sweater for cold weather outings. This is not a breed for outdoor living. Powderpuff coat care entails brushing every day or two. The muzzle is usually shaved every two weeks in Puffs. The Hairless needs regular skin care such as application of moisturizer, sun block, or bathing to combat blackheads.	50	90	22	26
60	Shar-Pei	3	3	1	1	1	3	1	4	1	2	4	5	Non-sporting	Mastiff, Oriental	China	Ancient times	Chinese Shar-Pei	The Shar-Pei is compact and square, with a head slightly large for their body.  The coat can be of either brush (not to exceed 1 inch) or horse (very short) types, both it should be extremely harsh, straight, and stand off the body. The gait is free, with good reach and drive. The wide jaws, scowling expression, and hippopotamus muzzle create a look unique to the breed.	The Chinese Shar-Pei may have existed in the southern provinces of China since the Han dynasty (around 200 b.c.). Certainly by the thirteenth century strong evidence in the form of writings describing a wrinkled dog point to the breed’s existence. Its origins are unknown, but because only it and the Chow Chow have blue-black tongues, and both come from China, it is likely that they share some common ancestry. The Shar-Pei’s history is difficult to trace because most records relating to its past were lost when China became communist. At this time Shar-Peis were the working breed of peasant farmers, fulfilling roles of guard dog and wild boar hunter.After the nation became communist, most of China’s dogs were eliminated, with only a few remaining outside of the cities. A few Shar-Peis were bred in British Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the Hong Kong Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1968. Around this same time, a few specimens came to America, but the turning point occurred with a 1973 article alerting American fanciers to the breed’s perilously low numbers. Touted as the world’s rarest dog, fanciers vied to obtain the few available Shar-Peis. The breed has since been brought from the brink of extinction to the height of popularity, and it is one of the most recognizable breeds in America. Though known for its loose skin and profuse wrinkles, which are superabundant in puppies, the wrinkles of adults may be limited only to the head, neck, and shoulders.	The Shar-Pei can be self-assured, serious, independent, stubborn, and very much self-possessed. Although not particularly demonstrative, he is devoted and may be very protective of his family. He is reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. He can be assertive toward other dogs and may chase livestock and other animals, although he is generally good with other family pets.	The Shar-Pei needs daily mental and physical stimulation, but his needs can be met with lively games throughout the day or a good long walk. The coat needs only weekly brushing, but wrinkles need regular attention to ensure that no irritations develop within the skin folds. The name Shar-Pei means sandy coat, referring to the gritty sandpaper texture of the coat. When rubbed backward, the prickly coat can be uncomfortable, and even cause welts on the skin of an occasional sensitive person.	45	70	17	20
29	Belgian Shepherd Tervuren	4	5	4	4	3	3	1	5	5	3	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Belgium	1800s	\N	This breed combines elegance and strength. Belgian Tervurens are square-proportioned and of medium bone. They are noteworthy for their exceedingly proud carriage. Their movement is lively, graceful, and seemingly tireless, exhibiting an easy, effortless gait rather than a hard-driving action. These dogs have a natural tendency to move in a circle rather than a straight line. They combine a dense undercoat with an outer coat consisting of abundant guard hairs that are long, well-fitting, straight and of medium harshness. Their expression is intelligent and questioning.	The Belgian Tervuren is one of four Belgian shepherd breeds, all sharing the same origins but distinguished by different coat types and colors. They are the wire-haired Laekenois, the shorthaired Malinois, the long black-haired Groenendael, and the long anything-but-black-haired Tervuren. All these herding– guard breeds were interbred before and after their recognition as one breed (the Belgian, or Continental, Shepherd) in 1891.The Tervuren was named after the village of Tervuren, where one of the breed’s earliest proponents lived. Tervurens lagged behind the other shepherd breeds in popularity, perhaps hindered by their less flashy color and disagreements over exactly what colors were desirable. The first Terv was registered in America in 1918, but the breed’s numbers remained so low that they died out by the Depression. The Tervuren had to be almost recreated after World War II from long-haired offspring of Malinois parents.In 1959 the Belgian Shepherd was divided into three breeds, and Tervurens were on their own. These dogs have since captured many eyes because they are the most elegant of the three breeds. They now enjoy moderate popularity. Belgian Tervurens are versatile dogs and are used less in guard work, but more in herding, than are their Belgian Shepherd counterparts.	Alert, watchful, and energetic, the Tervuren is an active and dependable companion that functions best when given daily mental and physical exercise. Tervurens enjoy playing and running outside, and can be well-mannered companions inside as long as they are given sufficient exercise. They are smart and obedient, but independent. They are aloof with strangers and can be protective of their family. They may nip at the heels of children in an attempt to herd them.	The Terv needs strenuous activity, either a long walk or jog or an invigorating play or work session every day. This breed especially enjoys herding, which is the ideal exercise. The double coat needs brushing and combing twice weekly, more often when shedding.	55	75	23	26
61	Chinook	3	3	3	4	4	4	2	2	3	3	4	3	Working	Northern	United States	1900s	\N	The Chinook was developed as a drafting and sled dog, combining the power of freight-hauling breeds with the speed of the lighter racing sled dogs. They have a moderate, athletic build, slightly longer than tall. The bone is moderate, with males noticeably more masculine than females. The coat is close-fitting but thick and double, providing insulation without overheating. The gait appears tireless with good reach and drive. The Chinook exemplifies a sound, northern athlete in grace, muscle tone, movement, and carriage.	The Chinook is largely the creation of one man, Arthur Walden of New Hampshire, who had experience as a musher in the Yukon. In 1917, he bred a large, tawny, mastiff-type farm dog to Admiral Peary’s Greenland husky lead dog, Polaris, to produce three puppies (Rikki, Tikki, and Tavi). Walden renamed one Chinook, and this dog became a prized lead dog. Walden and Chinook brought the sport of sled dog racing to New England. Chinook was bred to Belgian and German Shepherd working dogs, Canadian Eskimo Dogs, and possibly others. His offspring were named Chinooks in his honor.At almost age 12, the original Chinook and 15 other Chinook dogs were part of Admiral Byrd’s 1929 Antarctic expedition. Byrd described them as the backbone of the expedition. Unfortunately, Chinook died while there. The Chinook Trail in New Hampshire was renamed to honor Chinook. Walden subsequently passed on his kennel to another breeder, who did not continue the line. Instead, current Chinooks descend from three dogs—Jock, Hootchinoo, and Zembla— who were placed before the Antarctica expedition. Eventually, these dogs were passed to another breeder, who sold only males or spayed females so nobody else was able to breed them. After his death in 1965, another breeder continued.In 1965, the Guinness Book of World Records listed them as the rarest dog, with only 125 specimens. By 1981, only 11 breedable Chinooks remained. Several breeders fought to save the breed, crossing dogs with other Chinook foundation breeds and working to raise awareness of the breed. The UKC recognized the breed in 1991. In 2009, the Chinook became the state dog of New Hampshire. The breed entered the AKC Working Group in 2013.	Chinooks are calm, gentle, affectionate, and biddable. Unlike most sledding breeds, they tend to be reliable off lead. They are good with children, other dogs, and pets. However, some males can be assertive toward other male dogs. Most are reserved toward strangers, and some can be shy. They are generally quiet. Although not big barkers, they can be vocal and often talk or whine when excited.	Chinooks enjoy the company of their family, and should live inside. They tend to be mellow but need a long walk daily with chances to safely run off lead throughout the week. They are not natural retrievers. The coat requires weekly brushing but daily brushing during shedding seasons, as shedding can be heavy.	18	26	18	20
62	Chow Chow	1	2	1	2	1	3	1	4	1	3	5	5	Non-sporting	Spitz, Oriental	China	Ancient times	\N	The Chow Chow is an Arctic-type dog, powerful, squarely built, and sturdy with heavy bone and strong muscular development. They were bred for a number of tasks, and and their build reflects their ability to herd, pull, and protect. They can have either a rough coat, which is straight and offstanding or a smooth coat, which is hard and smooth; both coat types have wooly undercoats, providing ample insulation from the cold. The characteristic straight angulation of the hind legs produces a short, stilted gait unique to the breed. The scowling expression and black tongue are essential components of breed type.	The Chow Chow has some spitz characteristics. Because of this, it has been proposed that the Chow Chow either descends from spitz forebears or is itself an ancestor of some of the spitz breeds. Unfortunately, the origin of the breed has been lost in time, but it has been known in China for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.Its original purpose may have been as a hunting dog, sniffing out and even pointing birds for the nobility. The breed declined in quality and numbers after the Imperial hunts were ended, but a few pure descendants were kept in isolated monasteries and wealthy households. One of the most distinctive features of the breed is its black tongue, which was also the basis for its more common names in China.Only when dogs were brought to England along with other Chinese importations in the late 1700s was the name Chow Chow adopted. The name is probably derived from a term simply meaning Oriental knick knack and assorted curios, and may have come to be applied to the dogs because they were lumped into a ship’s log of cargo. These early imports were, in fact, looked upon as curios. Not until the late 1800s was the breed imported to England and then America in earnest. Queen Victoria’s interest in these dogs helped draw attention to the breed. AKC recognized the Chow Chow in 1903. The breed’s distinctive noble look has always attracted fanciers, but in the 1980s the breed soared in popularity, peaking as the sixth most popular breed in America.	Dignified, even lordly, the Chow Chow conducts himself with reserve. He is not very demonstrative, even with his family, and he is somewhat suspicious of strangers. He can be independent and stubborn. He can be assertive toward other dogs but is generally good with other household pets. He may be serious and protective, devoted to his family.	This is an alert breed that needs regular, but not strenuous, outdoor activity. He does not do well in hot humid weather. His needs are best met with casual morning or evening walks in warm weather or several short play sessions throughout the day. The smooth type needs brushing once weekly; the rough type needs brushing every other day, and daily when shedding.	55	85	17	20
63	Cirneco dell’Etna	4	3	4	4	5	4	3	1	3	1	2	4	Hound	Sighthound, Primitive	Italy	Ancient times	Sicilian Hound	The Cirneco is a medium-sized breed that was bred to hunt by scent, hearing, and sight. They have an elegant, strong build, lightly constructed with long limbs and a square outline. The coat is short and sleek. In personality they are strong, lively and independent; always alert.	The Cirneco dell’Etna (pronounced ‘cheer-NAY-co’) traces back as much as 2,500 years ago on the island of Sicily, particularly in the area surrounding Mount Etna. The dogs hunted rabbits by scent and, to a lesser extinct, sight.The Cirneco resembles a small Pharaoh Hound, and the two breeds are undoubtedly related. It’s believed the Cirneco descends from the prick-eared, houndtype dogs of ancient Egypt that were spread by the seafaring Phoenicians. It’s possible the dogs became smaller over time because of limited food and no need for big hunters in the area, which lacked open spaces.Dogs resembling Cirnechi (plural form) are depicted on 5th to 3rd century b.c. coins from Segesta in Sicily. Legend has it that a thousand Cirnechi guarded an ancient temple dedicated to Adranos (fire god), and that the dogs could divinely discern—and attack— thieves and nonbelievers while guiding pilgrims to the temple. The breed was virtually unknown outside Sicily until 1932, when a visiting veterinarian published an article in an Italian hunting journal that outlined their poor outlook. The Baroness Agata Paternó Castello headed a group to revive the breed and worked diligently to do so until her death.In 1939, the Italian Kennel Club adopted a standard and recognized the breed. They came to America in 1996 and attracted more attention when they began lure coursing competitively in the late 1990s. In 2015, they were admitted into the AKC Hound Group where they are considered sighthounds.	The Cirneco is very affectionate, lively, and gentle. Although sighthound and primitive breeds are known for their independence, they are far less so than most. They are typically friendly to strangers and get along well with kids, other dogs, and pets. They do like to hunt and can be led away by rabbit trails or fleeing wildlife. They tend to be a busy dog, always involved in some sort of project! In keeping with their hunting heritage, they are seldom deterred by obstacles in the way of anything they want.	The Cirneco is a family dog that should live indoors with their people. The Cirneco is very clean and enjoys creature comforts—they like warmth and dislike cold. They need a moderate jaunt around the neighborhood or a lively backyard game daily. They are not natural retrievers or swimmers but may be taught to do both. Coat care entails a quick weekly brushing.	50	75	22	26
64	Clumber Spaniel	2	2	3	4	3	4	3	1	3	3	4	2	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	England	1700s	\N	The Clumber Spaniel is a long, low dog, rectangular in shape and with massive bone. This build, in combination with a deep chest, heavy brow, and powerful hindquarters, once enabled the dog to move through thick underbrush when hunting. The coat is straight, flat, soft, and dense, imparting resistance to weather. The white color helped the hunter locate the dog.	The stockiest of the spaniels, the Clumber is also one of the oldest, dating to the late 1700s. Although the exact derivation of the breed is unknown, it is likely that the old heavy-headed Alpine Spaniel and the low-bodied Basset Hound played prominent roles in its development. The breed did not get its name until around the time of the French Revolution, when it is believed that the Duc de Noailles of France moved his spaniel kennels to the Duke of Newcastle’s English estate, Clumber Park.Clumber Spaniels appealed to the English nobility, who appreciated this slow-moving but especially keen-nosed hunter that was also an adept retriever. The breed was not readily available to commoners because the nobility discouraged its popularity except among higher society. As befitting their high status, Clumbers were among the earliest breeds to be shown. They came to America in the late 1800s.	At home he tends to be low-key, quiet and may even need to be goaded into exercise. He is one of the few sporting breeds suitable for city life, although he will relish walks and outings. The Clumber makes a good pet, especially devoted to one person.	The Clumber enjoys a daily outing, but his exercise requirements can be met with a long walk on leash or a leisurely hike in the field. The coat needs brushing two to three times weekly, although in dirty areas it may need more frequent bathing in order to keep his coat a gleaming white. Clumbers tend to drool and, at times, snore.	8	15	9	11
65	Collie	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	2	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Scotland	1800s	\N	The Collie is an active, lithe, strong dog that combines strength, speed, and grace. Their gait suggests effortless speed as well as the ability to change speed and direction instantly, as required in herding dogs. The coat can be of two types, both with a soft, abundant undercoat. The outer coat of the Smooth variety is short, hard, and flat; that of the Rough variety is straight, harsh, abundant, and long, particularly on the mane and ruff. The Collie’s expression is an important hallmark of the breed, and depends upon the shape and balance of the skull and muzzle, as well as the characteristics of the eyes and ears.	The derivation of the Collie is as obscure as the derivation of its name. One theory of the breed’s origins is that it was derived from the same root stock as the Border Collie. One theory of the name’s origin is that it was derived from a Gaelic word meaning useful, which certainly described the useful farm or stock dogs valued by the Celts who first settled on the British Isles. Although sheepherding and guarding are some of the most ancient of canine services, evidence of the Collie dates only from about 1800. Both rough- and smoothcoated “Scotch” collies existed by that time. Smooth-coated littermates were chosen as drovers, and rough-coated dogs were to stay out with the flock in all weather.As the breed caught the interest of dog fanciers, both rough- and smooth-coated Collies became taller and more refined. The rough-coated Collie was especially influenced by the progeny of a dog named Old Cockie, born in 1867 and thought to be responsible not only for setting type but also for popularizing the sable color. In 1860 Queen Victoria became enthusiastic about the breed and added her first Collie to her kennel. Under her sponsorship, the Collie’s popularity grew with dog fanciers and the upper class. By 1886 a standard was drawn up that still describes the breed as it is today.Meanwhile, as sheepherding became more important in America, settlers brought Collies with them to the New World. America’s social elite brought back fine Collies from Europe, and soon the Collie could be found in some of the most prestigious estates in America. Later the Collie found a champion in Albert Payson Terhune, whose stories about Collies heightened their popularity with people from all walks of life. The most famous Collie of all, the movie and television star Lassie, further popularized the breed, helping to make the Rough Collie one of the all-time favorite breeds in America.	The Collie is gentle and devoted, a mild-mannered friend to all. He is a dog with a working heritage, and he needs daily mental and physical exercise or he can become frustrated. He is sensitive, intelligent, and willing to please, although he is sometimes a bit stubborn. He can nip at heels in play. Some may bark a lot.	A good walk or jog on leash or a fun play session is needed every day. Herding is an excellent exercise. The coat of both varieties needs weekly brushing to remove dead hair, with the Rough requiring more time.	60	70	23	27
66	Coton de Tulear	4	2	4	5	5	5	5	1	4	5	3	2	Non-sporting	Barbichon	Madagascar	1500s	\N	The Coton de Tulear is a hardy, sturdy yet small dog. Although bred as a companion, it once survived on its own. Their hallmarks are a bright personality and profuse, white, cottony coat. The approximately 4 inch coat has the texture of soft cotton. It is dense and abundant and stands off the body. It’s believed its texture allows air to circulate within it, insulating the dog from heat and cold. The white coloration is another breed hallmark. However, puppies may be born with spots, mostly around the head and ears, which fade with age.	The Coton de Tulear (pronounced co-TAWN day-too-LEE-are) means Cotton of Tulear in French, with cotton referring to its coat and Tulear coming from the sea port at the tip of the island of Madasgascar. These dogs’ ancestors, which are also ancestors to the Bichon Frise, Maltese, and Bolgnese, were kept as companions on sea trading ships. One of these ships sunk off Tulear, and several little white dogs survived and came ashore. Some became feral and mixed with native dogs. In the 17th century, the native Merina people adopted the dogs and presented them to the Merina nobility. When the French laid claim to Madagascar in the late 17th century, French nobility adopted the dogs and decreed no commoners could own them. They became known as the Royal Dog of Madagascar.When Madagascar attained independence in the mid 1900s, tourism increased and visitors took Cotons home with them. The first Coton came to America in 1974. The Fèdèration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) recognized the Coton in 1987, increasing demand and depleting native stocks. In 1992, Madagascar began limiting the number of exported Cotons. There is some disagreement about the proper type of the breed between the prominent breed clubs, further fueled by disagreement over pursuing AKC recognition. The AKC admitted the Coton de Tulear into the Non-Sporting group in 2014.	The Coton is a playful, merry, boisterous companion, eager to entertain and please. He is very affectionate and loves to be loved. He typically gets along with strangers, children, other dogs, and other pets.  Many are easily trained. He is calm inside. Although not a big barker, he can still produce an assortment of vocalizations.	The Coton is active indoors and can run off most of his energy with lively games inside or in the yard. However, walks are also necessary for mental stimulation. Although shedding is minimal, coat care is the breed’s biggest challenge because the coat tangles and mats easily. Brush with a pin brush daily. Any leaves or twigs in the coat must be removed immediately before they cause a tangle. Weekly bathing is recommended.	16	32	8	9
67	Curly-Coated Retriever	3	3	3	3	3	4	2	2	3	1	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	England	1700s	\N	The Curly Coated Retriever may be the most graceful and elegant of the retrievers, appearing longer legged and more agile than the others. They are an active land retriever and a hardy water retriever, able to withstand the rigors of repeated retrieves into heavy thickets or cold waters. Their distinctive coat provides protection from cold and briars and is made up of a dense mass of tight curls.	One of the oldest and most distinctive of the retriever breeds, the Curly-Coated Retriever may have been used in England for retrieving as long ago as the late eighteenth century. Although its exact origin remains conjectural, it probably stems from crosses of the descendants of the Old English Water Dog with the Irish Water Spaniel, and a small type of Newfoundland. These breeds together combined some of the finest water dogs in existence into one animal.Later crosses to the Poodle, a fine water retriever in its own right, served to further enhance the tight curls. By the mid 1800s, the Curly-Coated Retriever was the most popular retriever in England, prized not only for its unsurpassed retrieving abilities but also as a staunch and trustworthy companion. It was among the first breeds to be exhibited at English dog shows.Exports to Australia and New Zealand were well received, and the breed still enjoys great popularity there. The first exports to America were in 1907, with the breed receiving AKC recognition in 1924.	The Curly-Coated Retriever is an eager and tireless land and, especially, water retriever outdoors, but a calm companion indoors. He is sensitive and gentle, very good with children, and responsive to commands. He is reserved with strangers. One of the most courageous of the retrievers, he is nonetheless quite sensitive. He makes an ideal partner for an active, outdoor-oriented person who also wants a loyal family companion.	The Curly can be an easy dog to maintain, requiring no unusual care. He needs daily exercise, preferably involving swimming and retrieving. Because brushing diminishes the tight curls, he should be combed only occasionally, preferably before getting wet.	40	60	19	23
68	Dachshund	4	2	3	3	3	2	1	2	2	2	3	5	Hound	Scenthound	Germany	1500s	Teckel	The Dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: the smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the long hair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick, and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.	Definitive evidence of the Dachshund as a breed isn’t found until the sixteenth century, when reference was made to a “low crooked legged” dog called a Little Burrow Dog, Dacksel, or Badger Dog. The modern name “Dachshund” means simply badger (dachs) dog (hund) in German.The Dachshund comes in three coat varieties and two sizes. The original Dachshunds were smooth coated and arose from crosses of the Bracke, a miniature French pointer, with the Pinscher. Some evidence exists of longer-haired Dachshund-like dogs in sixteenth-century woodcuts. It is also possible that smooth Dachshunds were later crossed with spaniels and the German Stoberhund (a gundog) to produce the long-haired variety. Mention is made of wire-coated Dachshunds as early as 1797, but these dogs were not carefully bred and most modern wires were created around the end of the nineteenth century by crossing smooth Dachshunds with German Wire-haired Pinschers and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.Each of these varieties was best suited for hunting under slightly different terrain and climatic conditions, but all were tough, strong dogs capable of dispatching badger, fox, and other small mammals. Before 1900, very small Dachshunds were kept for going to ground after small quarry, such as rabbits. Although some were simply runts, others were intentionally produced by crosses with toy terriers or pinschers. Most of the resulting miniatures lacked Dachshund type, however.By 1910, stricter criteria were adopted for type, and each coat type was crossed with different breeds to achieve the best results: smooths were bred with the Miniature Pinscher, longs with the Papillon, and wires with the Miniature Schnauzer. The Dachshund has since found its real niche as a family pet, steadily rising in popularity to hold a place as one of the most popular hounds in America.	The Dachshund is bold, curious, and always up for adventure. He likes to explore and dig, tracking by scent. He is independent but will join in his family’s activities whenever given a chance. He is good with children in his own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.	Although active, the Dachshund’s exercise requirements can be met with moderate walks on leash and games in the yard. He is amenable to city life or apartment living, but it is still a hunter by history and enjoys supervised forays into the field. The smooth coat requires minimal grooming. The long coat requires brushing or combing once or twice weekly and occasional trimming of stray hairs. The wire coat requires brushing or combing about once a week, with occasional trimming of stray hairs and professional grooming to remove dead hair twice a year.	18	24	8	11
69	Dalmatian	4	3	3	5	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	4	Non-sporting	Unknown	Yugoslavia	Ancient times	\N	The Dalmatian is a square-proportioned, athletic dog of good substance and sturdy bone. They are built for efficiency at the trot and great endurance, and their movement should be steady and effortless. The expression is alert and intelligent; the coat short and sleek.	The spotted Dalmatian is the most distinctly patterned breed of any dog, but the origin of its coat pattern is unknown. In fact, although art evidence points to an ancient origin, the time and place of the breed’s birth is also unknown. It gets it name from Dalmatia, a region in western Yugoslavia, but it probably did not originate there. Their ancestors may have included a small version of the spotted Great Dane or pointers, though this, too, is conjectural. Even the breed’s original function is unclear, but that is more likely because of its use in so many roles rather than any lack of employment. These roles included war dog, sentinel, shepherd, draft dog, retriever, trailer, and even circus dog.It was as a coach dog in Victorian England, however, that the Dalmatian found its niche. The coach dog served both a practical and anesthetic role; it protected the horses from marauding dogs and added a touch of style to the procession. The dogs would trot alongside, in front, or beneath the axle (considered the most elegant position) of the coach; interestingly, some evidence exists that coaching position may have a hereditary component.With the advent of the automobile, the Dalmatian lost their place in high society, and their popularity declined. They continued as a coach dog for horse-drawn fire engines, and this association led to their adoption as the modern “fire-dog.” The Dal was AKC recognized in 1888. Their flashy coloration has always ensured that it has been popular as a pet and show dog; however, it has had extreme ups and downs in popularity. Impulse buying followed movies featuring Dalmatian stars, followed by a backlash when so many of these unprepared homes were ill suited for Dalmatian ownership and laid the blame on the breed.	Bred to run for miles, the Dalmatian retains this tireless enthusiasm. He is a playful, eager companion that must get daily hard exercise in a safe area if it is expected to behave at home. He loves to run and may roam. He may be assertive toward strange dogs, but he is generally good with other pets and is especially good with horses. He may be too energetic for young children. He tends to be reserved toward strangers. He can be stubborn. Note: Deaf Dalmatians present special training and behavioral challenges.	The Dalmatian needs a lot of regular exercise and attention. He needs more than a short walk on leash; he makes a good jogging companion. He can also have his needs met with vigorous games and runs. The coat needs only occasional brushing.	65	90	24	28
70	Dandie Dinmont Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	2	3	3	4	Terrier	Terrier	Border of Scotland and England	1700s	\N	Unlike the prototypical terrier, the Dandie is made up of a series of curves, ending in a scimitar-shaped tail of moderate length. The Dandie is almost twice as long as tall, constructed to go to ground after tough quarry. Its hind legs are definitely longer than its front legs. Its gait is free and easy. It has a distinctive coat made up of about two-thirds hardish (not wiry) hair and one-third soft hair, about 2 inches in length. The head is covered with soft, silky hair, lending to the appearance of a large head. The topknot also enhances the expression, which is determined, dignified, soft, and wise. Tassels on the ear tips of the same texture and color as the topknot enhance the look.	The Dandie Dinmont Terrier stands out as a most unusual terrier in appearance, yet its roots are as quintessentially terrier as any. It first appeared as a distinct type of terrier in the eighteenth century around the border country of Scotland and England. Here they were owned by farmers and gypsies and valued for drawing and killing otters, badgers, and foxes. At one time, they were known as Catcleugh, Hindlee, or Pepper and Mustard terriers. The most well known of these dogs were owned by James Davidson, who named almost all his dogs either Pepper or Mustard along with some identifying adjective. Davidson and his dogs are believed by some to have been the models for Sir Walter Scott’s characters of Dandie Dinmont and his dogs in his novel Guy Mannering, published in 1814. The dogs became known as Dandie Dinmont’s Terriers. A letter written by James Davidson proclaimed that all Dandies descended from two of his dogs named Tarr and Pepper. At one time the breed was included in the general family of Scotch Terriers, which encompassed several short-legged terriers now recognized as distinct breeds. The Dandie was recognized separately from this group in 1873. The Dandie Dinmont has never been extremely popular, and remains one of the lesser-known terriers. An old Scottish saying says, “A Dandie looks at you as though he’s forgotten more than you ever knew.”	The Dandie Dinmont is no “dandified” dog; it is rough and tumble and ready for the hunt. Yet it functions well as a dignified house pet, affectionate but not doting. It is a loyal companion suitable for people of all ages, but it does need daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is intelligent and very independent. It tends to be reserved with strangers and aggressive toward strange dogs. Some dig.	The Dandie enjoys the chance to hunt around and explore in a safe area and needs a moderate walk to stay in condition. Its coat needs combing twice weekly, plus regular scissoring and shaping. Shaping for show dogs is done on an almost continual (but light) basis; that for pets can be done by stripping or clipping about four times a year. When clipped, the coat will lose its characteristic texture and color.	80	100	24	27
71	Doberman Pinscher	4	3	3	3	2	3	1	5	5	1	3	5	Working	Mastiff	Germany	1800s	Dobermann	The Doberman is compactly built, muscular and powerful. They combine elegance and strength, speed and endurance. Their carriage is proud and alert, and their gait is free and vigorous. The Doberman coat is short, smooth, and hard, showing off the exceptionally clean-cut lines of this athletic breed.	Few people can claim to have had so great an impact upon the dog world as Louis Dobermann of Thuringen, Germany. Herr Doberman was a door-to-door tax collector who needed a dog to accompany him on his rounds. In the late 1800s he set about to create an alert streamlined guard dog, most likely by crossing the old German Shepherd and German Pinscher, with later crosses to the Black and Tan Manchester Terrier, Greyhound, and Weimaraner. He soon obtained the prototype of the breed that now bears his name.The original Dobermans were still somewhat heavy boned and roundheaded; subsequent breeders selected for a more racy-looking dog. The breed evolved in remarkable time; by 1899 the first breed club was formed. The breed continued to attract acclaim, and the first Doberman arrived in America in 1908. They soon found favor throughout Europe and America as a police dog, and later as a war dog. Their prowess in these areas soon brought more admirers, and the Doberman quickly became a valued family pet. Their chiseled silhouette and fearless alert demeanor has made the Doberman a top contender as a show dog.As their fame grew, many families grew to appreciate the breed as a family pet, and the Doberman eventually rose to be the second most popular breed in America in 1977. Unfortunately, the media cast the Dobe in the role of a vicious breed and their reputation unfairly suffered. During this same time period, albinistic white Dobermans emerged. In an effort to decrease the chance of producing these dogs, the Doberman Pinscher Club of America convinced the AKC to tag the registration numbers of dogs with the likelihood of carrying the albino gene with the letter Z (a DNA test is now available).	The Doberman Pinscher is an intelligent capable guardian, ever on the alert and ready to protect its family or home. He is also a loyal and adventurous companion. He likes to be mentally challenged, and is a gifted obedience, agility, and Schutzhund pupil. He is sensitive, and very responsive to his owner’s wishes, though some can be domineering. He is generally reserved with strangers. It can be assertive with strange dogs.	This is an active breed that needs daily mental and physical exercise lest they become frustrated or destructive. Their exercise requirements can be met with a long jog or walk on leash, or a strenuous run in a safe area. Coat care is minimal.	99	110	23	27
72	Dogo Argentino	4	4	3	3	1	1	1	5	2	1	3	2	Molossoid	Guardian (UKC), Miscellaneous (AKC)	Argentina	1928	\N	The Dogo Argentino’s powerful athleticism is on full display with his large, sleek, muscular body that’s just slightly longer than it is tall. He’s easily recognized by his short, snow white elastic-like coat and prized for his keen scent ability and explosive agility and energy. His broad, domed head, supported by a thick neck and deep chest, is accented by a striking muzzle and alert, intelligent expression.	The Dogo Argentino was developed as a hunter of big game, such as wild boar and puma, with strong guarding instincts. Argentine physician Dr. Antonio Nores Martinez began the breed’s early development in 1928 by methodically crossing a local breed called the Old Fighting Dog of Cordoba with Mastiffs, Bulldogs and Bull Terriers. In addition to his supreme hunting skills, the Dogo Argentino also became known as a noble companion and loyal protector. The Federacion Cinologica Argentina recognized the Dogo Argentino in 1964, followed by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1973, notably as the first and only Argentinian breed. In the United States, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2001 and currently is in American Kennel Club’s miscellaneous class. Still known today for his strength and tenacity, the Dogo Argentino continues to serve as a hunting dog, guardian, family companion and general working dog.	The Dogo Argentino is humble and courageous with a strong instinct to protect his home and human family. Because such, it’s important he is properly trained and socialized as a puppy to make the distinction between familiar faces and strangers. Kind and loving by nature, the friendly, cheerful Dogo Argentino enjoys quality time with his closest companions.	Because of the Dogo Argentino’s short, glossy coat, he requires minimal grooming — weekly brushing and the occasional bath is all that’s needed. His strong nails grow quickly and should be trimmed regularly. The Dogo Argentino has a lot of energy to expand and therefore requires plenty of daily activity. Playtime in a fenced yard or being taken on a few walks a day is sufficient, though indoor exercise, such as chasing balls or playing hide-and-seek, also will keep him engaged. The Dogo Argentino also enjoys swimming, hiking, retrieving balls and catching flying discs and can be trained for agility, obedience and rally.	42	75	21	24
73	Dogue de Bordeaux	2	2	2	4	1	3	2	5	2	2	5	5	Working	Mastiff	France	Middle Ages	French Mastiff, Bordeaux Mastiff, Bordeaux Bulldog	The Dogue de Bordeaux is a typical brachycephalic molossoid type, with a short, broad skull, massive head, and powerful physique. The body is slightly longer than tall, and the distance from the chest to the ground is slightly less than the depth of the chest. This dog has a massive head, serious expression, stocky and athletic build, and self-assured attitude.	It’s difficult to unravel the Dogue de Bordeaux’s origin from that of other Mastiff and Bulldog breeds. It probably predates the Bullmastiff, and possibly even the Bulldog, or it may come down from the Bulldog or the Tibetan Mastiff. It may descend from a now extinct breed, such as the ancient Roman molosser or the ancient French Dogue de Bordeaux of Aquitaine. It’s likely the breeds were interbred so that their histories are forever intertwined. But it’s generally thought that the breed (or a strain resembling it) existed in southern France as early as the 14th century.Early Dogues de Bordeaux were classified into three types (Parisian, Toulouse, and Bordeaux) depending on the region and job, and they came in several colors. They had cropped ears, as did all fighting dogs. Aside from fighting, Dogues were used to bait bulls and bears; control cattle; and guard property and people, particularly the rich. During the French Revolution, many perished with their wealthy owners.The first use of the name Dogue de Bordeaux was in 1863, following the exhibition of one at the first dog show. The first breed standard was published in 1896. Emphasis was placed on the pink nose, light eyes, and red mask to distinguish it from those with recent Mastiff crosses. The breed suffered setbacks after both world wars, but in the 1960s breeders began a concerted effort to revive it. A 1982 article in a dog magazine introduced the breed to American fanciers, and the 1989 movie Turner and Hooch introduced the breed to the American public (although few knew its name). The breed gradually gained followers, and it entered the AKC Working Group in 2008.	The Dogue de Bordeaux is extremely devoted and loyal. He tends to stay close to its chosen person or family at all times. They are eager to please but may not be particularly good at obedience unless it’s worth their while. Although males can be assertive toward other dogs, most are pretty mellow unless provoked. They get along well with other pets.	Dogues need a chance to stroll around the block and stretch their legs every day, but they don’t need to go jogging or have marathon fetch sessions. They tend to be quiet indoors. Their size and strength can present challenges to people with small quarters or minimal strength. Coat care is minimal. Drooling is abundant and may be less than desirable to those who are house proud or those who don’t like their clothes adorned with glistening streaks.	40	50	12	15
74	Dutch Shepherd	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	4	3	4	1	2	Shepherd	Herding (UKC), Miscellaneous (AKC) 	The Netherlands	1898	\N	The Dutch Shepherd resembles the Belgian Shepherd Dog in coat type and physical characteristics, sans color. His original herding abilities still intact, the Dutch Shepherd is lively, energetic and active with plenty of stamina, reflected in his physical appearance: his body is medium-sized, powerful and well-muscled and is slightly longer than tall.	A breed native to the Netherlands and dating back to 1898, the Dutch Shepherd was originally used as a sheepdog and all-purpose farm dog. Versatile and multifunctional, the Dutch Shepherd also is used as a companion and guard dog. By 1900, industrialization overtook flocks of sheep, and also consequently the shepherd dogs that herded the sheep, were largely replaced by industrialization and the repossession of land for alternate uses. Hence, the Dutch Shepherd was used for other tasks, such as police and military work. Regardless, he retained his natural herding ability to this day and is still often used for this purpose. The United Kennel Club welcomed the Dutch Shepherd into its Herding Group in 1995.	Intelligent, independent and determined, the Dutch Shepherd can have a mind of his own, but nonetheless is devoted, eager to please and obedient toward his owner. He is loyal and steadfast, serving as a vigilant watchdog. Proper socialization is a must for this relatively reserved breed.	The Dutch Shepherd’s brindle coat can be one of three types: short-hair, long-hair or rough-hair. All shed seasonally and thus require weekly brushing on average. Regular teeth brushing, ear cleaning and nail trimming, as well as the occasional bath, also are a must. The Dutch Shepherd thrives on having a job to do but is capable of turning the on-off switch for work, play and relaxation. He should be given plenty of mental and physical stimulation, and is an excellent fit for an active household with other dogs. Obedience training is recommended for the intelligent, independent Dutch Shepherd; without it, he may become high strung.	26	34	15	17
75	English Cocker Spaniel	3	3	4	5	5	5	4	2	4	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	England	1800s	\N	The English Cocker was bred to find, flush, and retrieve upland game birds during a full day of hunting. The dog is slightly taller than long, compactly built, and short coupled. The English Cocker has a driving, powerful gait that covers ground effortlessly. The coat is of medium length, silky in texture, and either flat or slightly wavy. The feathering should not be so profuse that it becomes a hindrance in the field, but it should be long enough to protect the underside of the dog. The expression is soft and melting, yet dignified.	The spaniel family is one of the largest groups of dogs, and one of the most specialized. The English Cocker Spaniel is one of the land spaniels. The land spaniels consisted of larger spaniels that were better for springing game, and smaller spaniels that were better for hunting woodcock. These different sizes appeared in the same litters and were essentially two variations of the same breed. Only in 1892 were the two sizes considered separate breeds, with the smaller size (under 25 lb) designated as the Cocker Spaniel. In fact, because both breeds shared the same gene pool, they still share many of the same hunting talents.In 1901, the weight limit was abolished. Cocker Spaniels became extremely popular in England, but American breeders strove to change the breed in ways that traditional English Cocker Spaniel enthusiasts objected to. English and American Cocker Spaniels were shown together until 1936, when English Cocker Spaniel Club of America was formed and the English Cocker received status as a separate variety. The English Cocker Spaniel Club discouraged the interbreeding of the American and English Cockers, and in 1946 the English Cocker was designated a separate breed.After the breeds were separated, the American Cocker eclipsed the English in popularity—but only in America. Throughout the rest of the world, the English Cocker is by far the more popular of the two breeds and is known simply as the Cocker Spaniel. It is one of the most successful show dogs and popular pets of all breeds in Great Britain.	The English Cocker Spaniel retains more of his hunting nature than does the American version, and he also needs a little more exercise. He is cheerful, inquisitive, demonstrative, devoted, biddable, loyal, and sensitive. This is a sociable dog that likes to stay close to his human family.	Daily exercise is a necessity, either in the form of a long walk on leash, a good run in the field, or a lively game in the yard. The medium-length coat needs brushing two to three times per week, plus clipping around the head and ears and scissoring around the feet and tail every two months. The ears should be cleaned weekly.	45	65	23	26
76	English Coonhound	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	1	1	3	3	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1800s	Redtick Coonhound	The American English Coonhound combines speed with endurance, and as such has a moderate build with a strong but racy body. It is almost square proportioned, being just slightly longer than tall. The coat is hard, which provides protection from heavy brush and harsh elements. The muzzle is fairly broad, providing plenty of room for olfactory organs. Flews and hanging ears may help sweep and trap odor molecules. The trot is effortless, with good reach and drive, giving the impression of great endurance. The voice is a strong loud bawl that can be heard from great distances.	In colors of red, white, and blue, the American English Coonhound is as all-American as you can get–except, of course, for the English part. Created from English hunting hounds brought to America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the breed’s first American incarnation was known as the Virginia Hound. Selective breeding created a dog better suited to the tangled terrain of the southeastern United States and for hunting a variety of mammals including fox, raccoon, and sometimes, opossum, boar, and cougar. In 1905, the UKC recognized the breed as the English Fox and Coonhound. The name was eventually shortened to English Coonhound, which is still its name with the UKC. When the AKC recognized them in 2011 they took the name from the parent club, the American English Coonhound Association. Nobody objected to the Americanization, because by that time they were true American citizens. To add to the confusion, many people call them Redtick Coonhounds, because most have the red ticked pattern—although they also come in other combinations of red, blue, and white. The Bluetick and Treeing Walker Coonhounds were initially part of the same breed until the mid-1940s. Although most American English are red ticked, some are still tri-colored or blue ticked like their Bluetick and Walker relatives. The breed embodies the American work—and play—ethic. Its primary role has always been that of a first-rate hunting hound. Known for its speed, endurance, and melodious voice, top hunters command top dollar.Cheerful, alert, affectionate, strong-willed, fun-loving, and mischievous, they enjoy outwitting owners by sniffing out trouble. Hunting is their first love. They are independent and apt to follow their nose in pursuit of a scent trail. They tend to be laid-back at home, eager to earn a treat, and reluctant to challenge authority but are easily distracted by scents when training. They enjoy the company of other dogs and get along well with everyone, even small animals if they’re raised with them. They are adequate watchdogs.	Although fairly quiet inside, this is a dog that lives for the outdoors. It needs to take in new smells and have the chance to investigate scents every day. A good daily jog will satisfy its exercise requirements. Inside, food must be kept well out of reach. Coat care consists of occasional brushing. Their loud bay is freely given.	• Major concerns: none • Minor concerns: none • Occasionally seen: CHD, ear infections • Suggested tests: (hip) • Life span: 11 to 13 years	55	75	23	27
77	English Foxhound	4	4	3	3	5	3	4	1	2	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	Great Britain	1700s	\N	The English Foxhound is of powerful build, with large bone. The size of bone at the ankle is considered especially important. This build, along with comparatively straight angulation of the stifles, favors stamina over speed.	Careful pedigrees have been kept of English Foxhounds since the late 1700s—longer than for any other breed. Still, the exact origin of the breed is unknown. Around 1750, a few men envisioned hunting foxes with swift horses and hounds. The hounds would have to be able to track a faint scent while on the run and to maintain their chase for hours.Foxhunting gained its appeal as a pastime of the wealthy, and packs of hounds were tended to by Masters of Foxhounds, who looked to the care and breeding of the dogs. As the aesthetic aspects of the hunt increased in significance, care was taken to produce dogs that looked good not only individually but also as a pack. Thus, pack members would usually share the same coat coloration, most often the black saddle over a tan body with white points.Foxhunting became so popular that by the late 1800s, 140 packs (each with about 50 hounds) were registered in England alone. Foxhounds came to America in the 1700s, although in time a good percentage of these dogs were bred with other dogs to produce the American Foxhound.	The English Foxhound makes a stately family member, and desires human or canine companionship. They usually get along well with horses, dogs, children, and other pets. They are avid sniffers and trailers, however, and need daily exercise in a safe area. This breed is tolerant, amiable, and gentle, even though they are not very demonstrative. Most are reserved with strangers. They may not be well suited for city life. They bay.	The Foxhound is an easygoing dog that nonetheless needs plenty of exercise. They can often run for miles, and they can make good jogging companions on leash or hiking companions in a safe area. The coat needs only occasional brushing.	45	75	23	28
78	English Pointer	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	1	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Pointer	England	1600s	\N	The Pointer combines athletic grace and power with a lean, muscular body, noble head, alert expression, and noble carriage. The gait is smooth and powerful, with head held high and nostrils wide, enabling them to cover a lot of ground while searching for airborne scent. The tail lashes from side to side when the dog gaits. The Pointer’s close coat is short and dense, giving a clean streamlined appearance. Field type pointers tend to hold their tails upright when on point.	The earliest Pointers were used in the seventeenth century not to point birds, but to point hare, which coursing Greyhounds were then unleashed to pursue. When wing-shooting became popular in the eighteenth century, the Pointer found their place as an adept bird locator. The ideal dog would find game, indicate its location, and remain still until the hunter could get ready to shoot—a task that was somewhat slow with the old flintlock guns.The early Pointer probably included in its genetic makeup some of the most talented breeds in existence: Greyhounds, Foxhounds, and Bloodhounds, as well as an old type of setting spaniel. Different countries developed different Pointer breeds. After the war of Spanish Succession (1713), British army officers returned home with heavy boned Spanish Pointers. These were later crossed with Italian Pointers to produce the modern Pointer. Pointers became popular for recreational hunting on large estates. Ideally, two Pointers were used so that the hunter could locate the bird precisely by cross-referencing the dogs’ points. When dog shows came in vogue in the late nineteenth century, Pointers were among the most prominent of the breeds shown; in fact, the Westminster Kennel Club was organized primarily for Pointers.	The Pointer needs lots of exercise or it can become frustrated and destructive. Because they are ever on the lookout for birds, they are easily distracted from everyday matters—but they are nearly impossible to distract once on point. They are gentle and sweet but may be too energetic and boisterous at times for very small children.	The Pointer needs exercise, and lots of it. They need at least an hour of exertion every day. They enjoy running and hiking. At home they need space to exercise outdoors and should not be expected to sit inside all day. They require only an occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	50	65	24	25
79	English Setter	4	4	3	4	3	4	5	2	3	3	3	4	Sporting	Setter, Pointer	England	1300s	\N	The English Setter is an elegant and athletic dog with the ability to run tirelessly at a good pace. Their trot is ground covering and effortless, with the head held proudly and a lively tail. The coat is flat, with feathering on the ears, underside, backs of legs, underside of thighs, and tail. Their markings are distinctive, consisting of flecks of color, sometimes with patches, on a white background.  The Laveracks tend to be larger, carry more feathering, often have deeper muzzle, and usually hold their tails nearly level when on point. The Llewellins tend to be smaller, faster, with less coat and often larger patches of color. They tend to hold their tails straight up when on point.	Even before the advent of the shotgun, when birds were often caught with a net, dogs were trained to crouch when they pointed game. These “setters” were the forerunners of today’s setters. The English Setter is the oldest known of this group, perhaps dating back to the fourteenth century. They were developed to locate game on the moors and then to freeze until the game was dispatched. The English Setter’s ancestors probably included the Spanish Pointer, Springer Spaniel, and large Water Spaniel.The cultivation of the English Setter through concerted pure breeding was undertaken by Edward Laverack beginning around 1825 and continuing for over 35 years. These dogs formed the basis of all English Setters today. Incidentally, the term belton was coined by Laverack to describe the roan or ticked flecks of color and comes from the town of Belton, where Laverack hunted. The other most influential breeder, Purcell Llewellin, obtained his foundation stock from Laverack but based his breeding on field ability alone. Llewellin crossed his Laveracks with unrelated English Setters to produce such outstanding field dogs that many were imported to America. The Laverack and Llewellin setters diverged, with the Laverack providing the foundation for the show setters and the Llewellin forming the foundation for the field setters. Both types have enjoyed steady popularity in America.	Bred to cover a lot of area when hunting, the English Setter is a lively dog that loves to hunt and run. This is especially true of dogs from field lines. If not given sufficient exercise, they can be overly lively inside, but with daily exertion, they are calm and tractable housedogs. Those from conformation lines are particularly laid back and gentle and excel with children and less active adults. This is an amiable, easygoing breed that typically gets along well with children, strangers, and other dogs.	The English Setter needs a lot of exercise every day, requiring at least an hour of hard exertion. The long coat needs regular brushing every two or three days. The white coat may be difficult to keep gleaming in some areas. Some clipping and trimming every month or two is advisable for optimal good looks.	45	60	18	23
80	English Shepherd	5	5	3	3	4	4	2	4	4	3	2	2	Shepherd	Herding (UKC)	British Isles	55 BC	\N	Confident with a sense of purpose, the English Shepherd is a true all-purpose working breed. This well-balanced medium-size dog is built for speed and agility, and his supreme intelligence makes him relatively easy to train. The English Shepherd’s keen herding ability, coupled with agility, stamina and perseverance, positions him as an excellent herding dog. He also is valued for his tracking, hunting and treeing abilities, and has the intelligence, athleticism and easy trainability needed to excel at obedience and agility.	The English Shepherd is believed to have resulted from a combination of dogs native to the British Isles with sheep and cattle dogs that Caesar brought to the British Isles when he invaded in 55 BC. These dogs assisted the Romans in herding livestock that were brought to help feed the troops. As the livestock dwindled, the extra dogs no longer needed were left to be used by natives to the area to breed with similar herding dogs to strengthen their natural instinct and other positive qualities. The first settlers brought the English Shepherd to the American colonies, and from there, followed the western development the United States. Esteemed for his herding ability and guarding instinct, this versatile, all-purpose breed has been recognized by the United Kennel Club since 1927.	The English Shepherd is courageous and gritty, always ready to perform the work for which he was bred at the drop of a hat. Alert and eager to please, the English Shepherd is a devoted family companion and loyal watchdog.	Because the English Shepherd is a working breed, he requires plenty of exercise. He’s not ideally suited for apartment dwelling and does better in a home with a fenced backyard or acreage with plenty of room to roam. Due to his high intelligence, the English Shepherd also requires as much mental stimulation as he does physical. Without proper training and socialization, he can become stubborn and bossy. The English Shepherd has a thick, soft and glossy coat that requires regular grooming, including weekly brushing and the occasional bath.	40	50	18	21
81	English Springer Spaniel	3	4	4	5	3	5	4	2	5	4	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	England	1800s	\N	The English Springer Spaniel is compactly built, upstanding with proud carriage, slightly longer than tall but with fairly long legs and a deep body. Their build should suggest a combination of strength, agility, and endurance. The outer coat is medium length, either flat or wavy, and the undercoat is soft and dense. This combination protects the dog from weather, water, and thorns. The gait is long and ground covering. The expression—alert, kindly, and trusting— is an essential feature of Springer type.	As the spaniels became increasingly specialized, the larger land spaniels that ranged farther afield became extremely useful at flushing or “springing” game. Before the advent of shotguns, the game was flushed into nets or then chased by falcons or Greyhounds. The first reference to springers referred to land spaniels in the late 1500s. Around 1800, distinct strains of carefully bred springers began to develop; one of the best known were those bred by the Duke of Norfolk. His dogs so heavily influenced the breed that for a while the breed was called Norfolk Spaniels.The name was changed to Springer Spaniel in 1900. The matter is complicated by the fact that the larger Springer and smaller Cocker Spaniels were simply size variations of the same breed. Only in 1902 did the English Kennel Club recognize the Springer as a distinct breed. In America, the American Spaniel Club was formed in 1880 and began the task of separating the Springer and Cocker sizes.	The English Springer Spaniel is cheerful, playful, and energetic, ready for a day in the field and an evening by the hearth. He does everything with gusto and may be overly enthusiastic unless given plenty of exercise. The typical Springer is the ideal family companion.	As an energetic and inquisitive dog, the Springer needs daily mental and physical exertion. An outing in the field, long walk on leash, and good obedience lesson can go far to making the Springer a calm and well-behaved house dog. Their coat needs brushing or combing one or two times weekly plus clipping and scissoring every two to three months.	8	14	10	11
82	English Toy Spaniel	1	1	3	2	4	4	2	1	3	3	5	4	Toy	Spaniel, Companion	England	1600s	King Charles Spaniel	The English Toy Spaniel is profusely coated with a silky, flowing coat. The coat can be straight or slightly wavy. It has heavy fringing, including feathering on the feet. The hallmark of the breed, however, is their head and expression. The head should be domed, with lustrous dark eyes and well-cushioned face, creating a soft appealing expression.	The English Toy Spaniel and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel share identical early histories. They began as one breed, probably resulting from crosses of small spaniels with Oriental toy breeds. Some evidence supports the theory that Mary, Queen of Scots, brought the first toy spaniels to Scotland with her from France. These “comforter spaniels” became very popular with the wealthy classes, and served as foot and lap warmers as well as delightful companions. They reached their height of early popularity during the seventeenth century reign of King Charles II, who so doted on his dogs that the breed was soon being called King Charles Spaniels—the name by which the breed is still known in England.These early dogs were all black and tan; other colors were developed later, with the first Duke of Marlborough credited with developing the red and white “Blenheims,” named after his estate. The red and white coloration may have come from crosses with Chinese Cocker Spaniels. The duke’s spaniels were said to be good hunting dogs for woodcock. Most proponents of the breed were more interested in having an eye-catching lapdog than a hunting dog, and in the ensuing centuries the King Charles Spaniel was bred down in size and selected for a rounder head and flatter nose. In America, the name was changed to English Toy Spaniel and is shown as two varieties: the red particolored Blenheim and black and tan particolored Prince Charles, and the red solid-colored Ruby and black and tan solid-colored King Charles. Sometimes called “E.T.s” or “Charlies,” the breed has continued to find favor with owners desiring an aristocratic but fun-loving lapdog.	The English Toy Spaniel enjoys rollicking romps. He is a lapdog par excellence, gentle, amiable, calm, and quiet, yet he is playful and attentive. He is devoted to his family and reserved with strangers. He may be somewhat stubborn.	Although he enjoys a nice walk on leash or a fun game in the house or yard, the English Toy Spaniel is not overly active and his exercise needs can be met with minimal effort. He does not do well in heat. His long coat needs combing twice weekly.	45	65	16	21
83	Entlebucher Mountain Dog	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	5	3	3	4	5	Herding	Mastiff	Switzerland	1800s	Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Cattle Dog	The Entlebucher is a medium-sized, compact, strongly muscled, elongated drover with ample bone. His herding style is driving, getting behind cattle and nudging them along. This requires an active, nimble, tough, and tireless dog. Too small a dog lacks the necessary power and too large lacks the necessary agility needed for the task. The Entle is longer than tall in a ratio of about 10 to 8. The coat is short but dense, with a harsh close-fitting outer coat for protection and a dense undercoat that supplies warmth without causing overheating. The bright markings may emphasize the dog to the cattle it is herding. The gait is fluid and ground-covering.	The Entlebucher Mountain Dog (pronounced ENT-lee-boo-ker or ENTELboo-ker) is the smallest of the four Swiss Mountain Dogs (the others being the Appenzeller, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Greater Swiss Mountain Dog). These dogs are also collectively known as Sennehund, which translates to the herdsman’s dog. All of these dogs descend from molossus type dogs that accompanied the Romans through Helvetia over 2,000 years ago. The two smaller Swiss Mountain breeds (the Entlebucher and Appenzeller) drove dairy cows in from mountain pastures, while the larger ones were livestock guardians and draft dogs.The first description of a dog (the Entlebucherhund) from the valley of Entlebuch was in 1889. At the time, the Entlebucher and Appenzeller were lumped as the same breed. In 1913, four of the small naturally bobtailed dogs were exhibited, and Professor Albert Heim, the expert on Swiss breeds, advocated their independent recognition. Nonetheless, crosses with German Shepherd Dogs in the early 1900s threatened the breed. World War I further threatened them; after the war not a single one could be found. Efforts of several breeders resulted in a breed standard and club in 1926, and 17 Entlebuchers were located. The Entlebucher became eligible to compete in AKC herding events in 2007 and in the AKC Herding Group in 2009.	The Entlebucher is extremely devoted and loyal, tending to stay close to their family. They learn quickly but retain an independent nature, not afraid to make their own choices—especially if they feel they have the upper hand. They are very loyal and may be protective. Their loud bark may be their biggest protective asset. They tend to be suspicious of strangers. They are generally good with other dogs and pets; however they may try to herd other pets and children. Although males particularly can be assertive toward other dogs, most are pretty mellow unless provoked.	Entles are active dogs that like to run and roughhouse. They need a good, long play period or hike daily, plus activities such as agility, obedience, or tracking to challenge their mind. They are fairly quiet indoors as long as they are tired! They are strong for their size. The coat should be brushed once or twice a week, more when shedding. They prefer cool weather.	35	50	17	18
84	Field Spaniel	3	3	3	5	3	5	3	2	4	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	England	1800s	\N	The Field Spaniel is a combination of beauty and utility. Their stride is long and low, with head held proudly and alertly and the tail wagging but not carried high. The Field Spaniel is built for both activity and stamina. They have a single coat, which is flat or slightly wavy and moderately long, giving it protection from thorns and water. The expression is grave and gentle.	The Field Spaniel shares their early history with the English Cocker Spaniel, the only difference between the two breeds initially being one of size. The Field Spaniel was composed of those land spaniels weighing over 25 pounds. These larger Field Spaniels were derived from the Cocker, Sussex, and English Water Spaniels and were initially required to be black. After becoming recognized as a separate breed in the late 1800s, the Field Spaniel succumbed to breeding for exaggeration, and the repeated infusion of Sussex Spaniel blood resulted in dogs of excessive length, overly heavy bones, and short legs. The breed lost its usefulness as a hunter, and although it enjoyed a short vogue in the early 1900s, it ultimately teetered on the brink of extinction.Crosses to English Springer Spaniels were made in an effort to recreate the original Field Spaniel. The crosses were successful, and the modern Field Spaniel is not only a handsome replica of its former self but also an able hunter. All modern Field Spaniels can be traced back to four Field Spaniels from the 1950s: Ronayne Regal, Gormac Teal, Colombina of Teffont, and Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas. Despite the fact that Field Spaniels were being shown in America in the late 1800s, no champions were made up between 1916 and 1966; in fact, the breed was essentially extinct in America for much of that time. The breed was reintroduced into America in the late 1960s. The Field Spaniel remains among the rarest of breeds in America.	The Field Spaniel is happiest when he has a job to do. Although independent in nature, he is devoted, sensitive, and willing to please. Generally cheerful and affectionate, he is an excellent family companion as long as he is given regular exercise. The Field Spaniel is especially known for his docile nature. It is typical for a Field Spaniel to be somewhat reserved with strangers.	The Field Spaniel needs daily exercise, and even though he is happiest when given the chance to run and explore, his needs can be met with a long walk on leash. His coat needs brushing and combing once or twice weekly. The hair inside the ears and between the foot pads should be clipped. The ears should be checked and cleaned regularly. Some can be somewhat sloppy, and some snore.	33	53	18	21
85	Finnish Lapphund	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	4	4	5	5	Herding	Spitz	Finland	Ancient times	Suomenlapinkoira	The Finnish Lapphund is a medium-sized dog with the look of a northern breed and the temperament of a herding breed. Bred to work outside, north of the Arctic Circle, they are strongly built and thickly coated. The breed has a greater substance than their size would suggest. Their bone is substantial and muscles are well developed. The coat is thick and profuse, with a straight, long outer coat that is very harsh and water-repellant. The undercoat, which is vital for insulation, is soft, very dense, and plentiful. Finnish Lapphunds must be agile and capable of sudden bursts of speed. They have a medium but powerful-appearing stride.	Ancient cave paintings and archeological digs suggest the nomadic Saame in Lapland (northern Finland, Sweden, and parts of Russia) have used spitztype dogs to herd reindeer for centuries, perhaps for thousands of years. The dogs, which were little known to the outside world, worked as gatherers, not drovers, to keep the herds together. In the 1900s, their use as herders diminished as snowmobiles took their place and the Saame became less nomadic. Invasions during World War II further damaged the remaining population, and a distemper outbreak after the war almost wiped them out completely.Realizing the breed could be lost without intervention, a group of Finnish dog breeders collected dogs, adopted a breed standard, and gained recognition by the Finnish Kennel Club in 1945. Both shorter and longer haired dogs were included together, as both often appeared in the same litters of the breed, then called Lapponian Shepherd Dogs. In 1967, the long-coated variety was recognized separately as the Lapinkoira, or Finnish Lapphund. The short-coated variety was called the Lapinporokoira, or Lapponian Herder. The Finnish Lapphund is now known as the Suomenlapinkoira in Finland, where it is one of the most popular breeds. The breed remained largely unknown in America. In 1987, an effort was made to establish them in America. Breed numbers grew slowly. The UKC recognized the Finnish Lapphund in 1994; and in 2011, the Finnish Lapphund became a member of the AKC Herding Group.	Lappies are gentle and devoted companions. They learn quickly but can also be independent and strong-willed. They tend to be submissive toward people. The breed has won many obedience awards in their native land. They generally get along well with other dogs and pets. Befitting their herding heritage, they bark when excited but, generally, not otherwise. They are very alert and aware of their surroundings.	As a breed developed to be on the move, the Lapphund enjoys an active lifestyle. They enjoy a long hike or vigorous game, preferably every day. They thrive on mental challenges, so training activities such as agility or obedience are helpful. Although an active breed, they are relatively calm indoors even if they miss a day of exercise. Their coat is thick and requires brushing once or twice a week— more during shedding season—to prevent matting. They much prefer cool weather.	23	36	16	20
86	Finnish Spitz	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	4	4	Non-sporting	Spitz	Finland	Ancient times	Suomenpystykorva, Finsk Spets	The Finnish Spitz has a foxlike appearance, incorporating the typical traits of a northern breed: small erect ears, dense double coat, and curled tail. They are square-proportioned, and without exaggeration, quick and light on their feet.  Their double coat, consisting of a short soft undercoat and harsh straight outer coat about 1 to 2 inches long, provides insulation from the snow and cold, which once allowed them to hunt tirelessly under the coldest of conditions.	The Finnish Spitz originated from ancestral northern spitz dogs that accompanied early Finno-Ugrian tribes as they journeyed across Eurasia to Finland. These dogs probably originated as camp followers and watchdogs, later developing into hunting dogs. The breed remained pure, not by design but by isolation until the early 1800s. When other groups of people brought their dogs to the region in the 1800s, interbreeding almost obliterated the pure Finnish Spitz.In the late 1800s, two Finnish sportsmen spotted some dogs that had apparently not been interbred, and they were so impressed that they determined to rescue the imperiled breed. Early names for the breed included Suomenpystykorva (Finnish Cock-Eared Dog) and Finnish Barking Bird Dog. When it first came to England it was called the Finsk Spets (derived from its Swedish name), but in 1891, the name was officially changed to Finnish Spitz. The breed gained its nickname of Finkie after its arrival in England in the 1920s. It wasn’t until the 1960s that Finkies began to be bred in the United States. The breed was officially admitted into the Non-Sporting Group in 1988.	Like most spitz breeds, the Finkie is independent and may be somewhat stubborn, although they are more hunting oriented than other spitz breeds. They are alert, inquisitive, and playful, but they are also sensitive, tending to be devoted to one person. They are a breed conscious of their place in the dominance hierarchy, and some males can try to be domineering. They are usually good with children, and generally good with other pets, but they may be assertive to strange dogs. They are reserved, even aloof or suspicious, with strangers. In keeping with their barking heritage, the Finkie is proud of their barking ability and likes to show it off— loudly!	This is an active and lively breed and needs daily exercise, either a long walk on leash or a run in a fenced area. As a hunting breed, care must be taken that they do not go off on a hunt by themselves. Their double coat needs brushing one or two times weekly, more often when shedding.	60	70	22	25
87	Flat-Coated Retriever	3	3	4	5	3	4	4	2	5	2	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	England	1800s	\N	“Power without lumber and raciness without weediness” is the traditional description of the Flat-Coated Retriever. Their head is distinctive, long and of “one piece,” all parts flowing smoothly into each other. The gait is ground covering, smooth, and efficient. The coat is thick and flat, of only moderate length, providing protection without adding weight. These attributes have resulted in a versatile and athletic canine capable of retrieving over land and water.	One of the earliest uses of retrieving dogs was to help fishermen retrieve fish and objects from the water. In the nineteenth century, such retrieving dogs were especially popular with the cod fisheries around Newfoundland. Of these dogs, the most popular breeds were the Labrador (not to be confused with the present Labrador Retriever) and several sizes of Newfoundlands.With the development of more advanced firearms, hunters were increasingly able to shoot “on the wing,” but they needed a dog to mark the fallen bird and bring it back. The fishery dogs were unrivaled swimmers and natural retrievers, and crosses between them and British breeds such as setters or pointers honed the dog’s bird sense. The result was the Wavy-Coated Retriever, and it became quite popular in America and England. In fact, it was among the earliest breeds to be shown at English dog shows.Near the end of the 1800s, crosses with a straighter-haired breed were made because the wavy coat was thought to be less water repellant. Crosses to setters and collies of the time may also have been made. The resulting Flat-Coated Retrievers became tremendously popular. The breed was not recognized by the AKC until 1915, by which time it had already begun to drop in popularity. By the end of the Second World War, the number of Flat-Coats had dwindled to the point that the breed was threatened with extinction. Concerted efforts to bring the breed back slowly succeeded, and the Flat-Coat now enjoys modest popularity as a companion and show dog, but has not regained its field presence.	The Flat-Coated Retriever is a sweet, exuberant, lively dog that loves to play and retrieve. They are on the go outdoors, but quiet indoors. This breed is among the most devoted and companionable of dogs, a true family dog. They need regular exercise to be on their best behavior, however. They are a sensitive breed and very responsive to training. Their hallmark is their wagging tail.	This active dog needs daily exercise and fun, and especially enjoys the chance to hike or swim. This is a family-oriented dog that does best when allowed to live inside and play outside. The coat needs only weekly brushing and little, if any, minor trimming occasionally.	28	28	11	13
88	French Bulldog	3	1	3	3	3	4	1	1	2	1	5	3	Non-sporting	Mastiff, Bull	France	1800s	Bouledogue Francais	Frenchies have a low center of gravity, wide body, heavy bone, muscular build, and large, square head with soft loose skin forming wrinkles about the head and shoulders. Entertaining home companions, these lapdogs are alert, with a curious expression, aided by bar ears, and unrestrained and free movement.	In the nineteenth century, the Bulldog was fairly popular in England, especially around Nottingham. When many of the lace workers of the region went to France for work in the mid-1800s, they took their “Toy” Bulldogs with them. The French women, especially, were attracted to these little Bulldogs, especially those with erect ears (a common but disliked feature in England). Dog dealers brought more of the clownish little dogs to France, where they soon became the rage of Paris. The dogs were dubbed Bouledogue Francais. French breeders sought to consistently produce the erect “bat ears,” much to the chagrin of English breeders. Some Bulldogs are quite small weighing less than 25 lbs, however, dogs in this breed on average, weigh 28 lbs. and can grow to be between 11” – 13” in size.Frenchies have a short, easy-to-maintain coat that doesn’t shed much.French Bulldogs are best known for: By the late 1800s, the breed had caught the attention of the upper class and had moved into some of the finer homes in France. Around this same time, American visitors to France brought several back to America and began to breed the dogs in earnest. Amid continued controversy over which ear type was correct, an American club was formed and, in 1898, sponsored one of the most elegant dog shows (just for French Bulldogs) ever held. The gracious setting attracted wealthy spectators, and the Frenchie had soon conquered America. Their popularity among high society soared, and by 1913 they were among the most popular show dogs in America. The breed has since been passed by many others in popularity, but it still boasts some of the most elite and ardent fans in dogdom. Brindle, cream, fawn and white. Lifespan: 9–11 years. The French Bulldog is a clown in a lapdog. They enjoy playing and entertaining their family, as well as cuddling and snoozing with their favorite person. They are amiable, sweet, companionable, and willing to please.     	Note: This breed does not tolerate heat well and may be sensitive to anesthesia.	 	25	35	17	20
89	German Pinscher	4	3	4	4	2	1	2	3	3	1	2	5	Working	Pinscher	Germany	1600s	\N	The German Pinscher is a medium-sized dog with a muscular square build. They are light enough to be extremely agile and solid enough to be strong. They can hike all day, aided by extremely sensitive senses. The German Pinscher has found a new niche as a companion and watchdog of ideal size and loyal temperament.	The progenitor of better-known Pinscher breeds, the German Pinscher is an old breed that can trace back to the German Bibarhund of the seventh century and the Tanner of the fourteenth century. In the 1600s dogs with this ancestry or type were mixed with Black and Tan Terriers, creating the Rattenfanger, a versatile working watchdog. The Rattenfanger became the Pinscher, and it remained a hard working dog for several centuries, especially valued for its rodent-catching ability around the stables.With the advent of dog shows in the late 1800s, interest in the Pinscher grew. The first Pinscher breed standard was drawn up in 1884. The breed didn’t garner immediate favor with dog fanciers and numbers fell. An effort to count, register, and exhibit Pinschers was thwarted by the world wars. After World War II the breed was on the verge of extinction. Between 1949 and 1958 not a single Pinscher litter was registered in West Germany. Now the Pinscher had to rely on its descendant, the Miniature Pinscher, for survival. Four oversize Miniature Pinschers were selected and registered in 1958 by the Pinscher-Schnauzer Klub in West Germany. A Pinscher female was smuggled from East Germany, where Pinschers still existed, and bred to three different MinPin males. Almost all current German Pinschers descend from these five dogs. German Pinschers began their presence in America in the late 1970s. In 2001 the AKC admitted the German Pinscher into its Miscellaneous class, and in 2003 it became a bonafide member of the Working Group.	Vivacious, tenacious, and courageous, the German Pinscher is a lively self-appointed property patroller. Ever alert, the German Pinscher does not bark frivolously, but does sound the alert to intruders. A quick learner, the German Pinscher is nonetheless not inclined to obey unless there’s a good reason to do so. The breed is playful and affectionate, and good with considerate children. They can be wary of strangers. German Pinschers may argue over which of them gets to be boss, and they may not be good with small pets.	German Pinschers like to be in the thick of things and do not appreciate being left outside alone or relegated to a kennel. This is a high-energy dog that is easily bored and frustrated if not given a way to stimulate their mind and exercise their body. Grooming is wash and wear; only occasional brushing is required.	75	95	22	26
90	German Shepherd Dog	3	4	2	3	1	3	2	5	5	2	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Germany	1800s	Alsatian, Deutscher Schaferhund	The German Shepherd Dog has an outline of smooth curves on a longer than tall body that’s strong, agile, substantial, and an exceptionally outreaching and elastic gait, covering the ground in great strides. The breed’s dense, straight or slightly wavy double coat comprises harsh, close lying medium length hair.	Perhaps never in the history of any breed has such concerted effort been put into improving a dog, mostly due to the formation in 1899 of the Verein fur Deutsche Scharferhunde SV, an organization in Germany devoted to overseeing the breeding of the German Shepherd. Breeders sought to develop not only a herding dog but also one that could excel at jobs requiring courage, athleticism, and intelligence. During World War I, they were the obvious choice for a war sentry. At the same time, the AKC changed the breed’s name from German Sheepdog to Shepherd Dog, and Britain changed it to Alsatian Wolfdog, both attempts to dissociate the dog from its unpopular German roots. The Wolfdog was later dropped as it caused many people to fear the dogs. In 1931, the AKC restored the breed’s name to German Shepherd Dog. Shepherds are considered a medium-to-large- sized dog, reaching a between 22” and 26” and weighing up to 95 lbs. fully grownThe double-coat, with a thick undercoat that sheds twice annually, loses hair continuously but can be maintained with regular brushing one or two times weekly.Black, tan, solid black and solid sable. Lifespan: 10–12 yearsGerman Shepherds are best known for: Despite an outward appearance slightly resembling a wolf, the German Shepherd Dog is a fairly recently developed breed and, contrary to naíve beliefs, it is no more closely related to the wolf than any other breed of dog. The greatest boon to the Shepherd’s popularity came in the form of two dogs, both movie stars: Strongheart and Rin Tin Tin. The German Shepherd held the number one spot in American popularity for many years. Although presently it has dropped from the top spot, the German Shepherd remains as one of the most versatile dogs ever created, serving as a police dog, war dog, guide dog, search-and-rescue dog, narcotics- or explosives-detecting dog, show dog, pet—and even shepherd.   Among the most intelligent of breeds, the German Shepherd Dog is so intent on their mission—whatever that may be— that they are virtually unsurpassed in working versatility. They are utterly devoted and faithful. They may be aloof and suspicious toward strangers, and protective of their home and family. They can be domineering. They can be assertive toward other dogs, but they are usually good with other pets.       Note: GSDs are especially susceptible to a potentially fatal systemic fungal infection from Aspergillus. 	 	 	45	70	21	25
91	German Shorthaired Pointer	5	5	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	1	3	5	Sporting	Gundog, Pointer, Versatile hunting dog	Germany	1600s	Deutscher Kurzhaariger Vorstehund, Kurzhaar	The German Shorthaired Pointer is an all-purpose close-working dog who combines agility, power, and endurance. He is square or slightly longer than tall; although he has a short back, he should stand over plenty of ground. He should have a clean-cut head, graceful outline, strong quarters, and an athletic physique. His coat is short and tough.	The German Shorthaired Pointer is one of the most versatile of hunting breeds, combining pointing, retrieving, and trailing abilities. This versatility arose through the purposeful blending of various breeds beginning as early as the seventeenth century.Crosses of the Spanish Pointer (a heavy type of pointer) with the Hannover Hound (a strain of scenthounds) resulted in a heavy houndlike dog that could both trail and point. Although all the early breeders agreed upon the goal of an all-purpose hunting dog, not all agreed upon how to achieve it. Crosses with the English Pointer were controversial but bestowed upon the breed a more stylish look and nose-up hunting mode. It also imparted a dislike of water and an aversion to attacking quarry. Further breeding eliminated these unwanted pointer characteristics.In the early 1800s two Deutsch Kurzhaars (as the breed was originally known), Nero and Treff, distinguished themselves against other pointing breeds at the German Derby and, through the success of their descendants, are often credited as the modern Shorthaired’s foundation. The breed was recognized in the late 1800s in Germany with the first Shorthaired coming to America in the 1920s. The German Shorthaired Pointer gained AKC recognition in 1930. The breed soon gained a reputation as the ideal dog for the hunter who wanted only one dog that could do it all.	The German Shorthaired Pointer’s idea of heaven is a day hiking in the field and an evening curled up by its owner’s side. This is an active dog that can become frustrated and “creative” if not given ample daily exercise, both mental and physical. He is a devoted family pet, although at times he may be overly boisterous for small children. Because part of their heritage includes hunting mammals, some can be assertive toward small pets unless raised with them. They are a sensitive breed, responsive to gentle training. Some can whine or bark a lot.	Bred to be an active hunting companion, this breed has a good deal of energy and requires a good deal of exercise. He thrives on mental and physical stimulation and can get both by hiking or playing with his owner for a long period—at least an hour—every day. Many like water and will swim if given the chance. The grooming needs are minimal, consisting only of occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	24	26	9	15
92	German Spitz	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	5	4	4	1	3	Spitz	Northern (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Germany	1450	\N	The German Spitz is a true Nordic breed with a short, compact and square body, prick ears, beautiful coat and tail that curls over his back. Alert and vocal with a keen sense of hearing, the breed has long been characterized and valued as a valiant defender of field and home. This small breed has two size varieties: the Klein and the Mittel.	A relatively new breed in the United States having been imported from Germany, England and Australia, the German Spitz was first documented as a valiant defender of home and field in 1450. Many early members of the breed, considered a peasant’s dog in the early days, were found in the province of Pomerania, from which came the breed’s early name, the Pomeranian. The German Spitz became quite popular with royalty in the 18th century. The breed is recognized with five size varieties in Germany, but when the Toy and Wolfspitz were exported to other countries, they were viewed as separate breeds: the Pomeranian and the Keeshond. In America, the German Spitz is viewed as one breed with two size varieties: the Klein and the Mittel. The United Kennel Club has recognized the German Spitz as a member of its Northern Group since 2006.	Intelligent, active and alert, the German Spitz has a confident, happy disposition. He remains a steadfast and devoted companion, always ready and eager to please his owner. The German Spitz doesn’t trust a stranger, positioning him as an ideal watchdog. Versatile and adaptable, the German Spitz is readily trainable, though he also can be independent from time to time. Proper training and socialization will help him get along well with other people and pets.	The German Spitz’s thick double coat should be brushed a couple of times a week to avoid matting and knotting, and when his coat inevitably sheds twice a year, daily brushing is a must. Occasional bathing is sufficient, as is regular nail trimming and ear cleaning. The German Spitz also requires regular exercise, such as playing a game of hide-and-seek, chasing a ball, going on a short walk or learning a new trick. No fence gap is too wide nor tree too tall for the insatiably curious German Spitz, who won’t stop at anything to find his next adventure. Bodies of water are dangerous to this breed and should be avoided, if possible. Intelligent and alert, the German Spitz is a quick learner and easily trainable. Because he’s a natural watchdog, the German Spitz is keen on barking at anything new or different, thus training is needed to nip this behavior in the bud.	45	75	24	26
93	German Wirehaired Pointer	5	5	4	3	2	3	2	4	3	3	3	5	Sporting	Gundog, Pointer, Versatile hunting dog	Germany	1800s	Deutscher Drahthaariger Vorstehund, Drahthaar	A sturdily built dog, the German Wirehaired Pointer should be able to hike all day through all types of terrain. The weather-resistant, straight wiry coat is an essential breed characteristic. The outer coat is about 1 to 2 inches long, long enough to protect against brambles but not so long that the outline of the dog is obscured. The eyebrows, beard, and whiskers are of medium length. The undercoat is thick in winter for warmth but thin in summer. The coat repels water.	When game-bird hunting became accessible to persons of average means, demand for both specialist and versatile hunting breeds soared. The quest for versatile breeds reached its height in Germany, and the German Wirehaired Pointer represents one of the most successful results. Hunters wanted a dog that would locate and point upland game, retrieve waterfowl from land or water, and also function as companion. They were developed to be a close worker over any kind of terrain.A rough wiry coat was needed to hunt through dense brambles. Their most important ancestor was the Pudelpointer (itself a combination of the old German Pudel and the Pointer), which was crossed with the early German Shorthaired Pointer, Griffon, Stichelhaar, and Polish Water Dog. It was not recognized there officially until the 1920s, the same time the first Wirehaired came to America.The German Wirehaired Pointer was recognized in America in 1959 but has never gained the popularity that they enjoy in their native land.The German Wirehaired Pointer can be both a rugged sporting dog and amiable companion. They have the energy to hike for hours, so they must be given a daily outlet lest they become destructive. They are a responsive breed, although some may be stubborn.	They have retained a guarding instinct, so they can be aloof, even protective, toward strangers as well as strange dogs.They are generally good, if sometimes overly boisterous, with children. They are ideal for the outdoor-oriented person wanting a tireless, intelligent partner.	Exercise is a daily requirement for this energetic dog. At least an hour a day of exertion is recommended, and the ideal situation would combine exercise with hiking or a chance to run and explore afield. Like most harsh coats, some professional grooming may occasionally be needed to maintain a sleek outline; otherwise, brushing about once a week will suffice. GWPs are low shedders.	65	90	24	28
94	Giant Schnauzer	3	4	4	1	1	2	1	5	3	3	3	5	Working	Livestock dog, Herding, Schnauzer	Germany	Middle Ages	Riesenshnauzer	This is a larger, more powerful version of the Standard Schnauzer. Their body is strong, compact, and nearly square, combining great power with agility. The stride is free and vigorous, with good reach and drive. Their double coat consists of a soft undercoat and a harsh, wiry, dense outer coat, a combination that once enabled them to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. Their hallmark beard and eyebrows, coupled with their smart outline, make a striking figure.	The Giant Schnauzer originated in the countryside of Bavaria and Wurrtemburg. Cattlemen there were impressed by the smaller Standard Schnauzer, and sought to emulate them on a larger scale that would be suitable for driving cattle.It is likely, though not documented, that they crossed the Standard Schnauzer with their larger smooth-coated cattledriving dogs in an attempt to create a wire-haired drover. Later crosses with rough-coated Sheepdogs and the Great Dane and Bouvier des Flandres probably occurred, and even crosses with the black Poodle, Wolf Spitz, and Wirehaired Pinscher have been suggested.The result was a weather-tolerant, smart-looking dog capable of handling cattle, then known as the Munchener. They later became more popular as butcher’s or stockyard dogs.The dogs maintained a low profile, with little exposure until just before World War I, when it was suggested that they could be trained as police dogs.They have gained more headway as a pet in recent years, however, and now enjoy modest popularity in America.	The playful, rambunctious Giant Schnauzer may be too boisterous for small children, even though they are otherwise very good with children in their own family. They are bold and loyal to their family and reserved with strangers. They may be assertive toward other dogs. This intelligent and exuberant breed is a good choice for an active person wanting a partner in adventure, although at times the Giant may try to be the leader.	The Giant Schnauzer needs daily exercise and daily fun. Their exercise requirements can be met with vigorous games and long hikes or walks. Their harsh coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus shaping two to four times yearly. Shaping is best done by a professional groomer.	35	35	13	14
95	Glen of Imaal Terrier	3	3	5	4	2	3	3	2	3	2	4	2	Terrier	Terrier	Ireland	Unknown; possibly 1600s	Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier	Longer than tall, the Glen’s short, bowed front legs, well-muscled loin, rising topline, and strong rear allow him to dig and then get adequate leverage to back out of a hole dragging a struggling badger that might weigh more than the Glen itself. The medium-length coat is harsh with a soft undercoat, and is less prone to mat or catch burrs than a longer, softer coat.	Ireland is a land known for its lush vistas, but not all of Ireland is cloaked in emerald. The Glen area, in County Wicklow, is a bleak land strewn with rocks in which people toil to make a meager living. But Ireland is also a land known for its terriers and its leprechauns, and the Glen area has its own special magical terrier: the Glen of Imaal Terrier.In this harsh land, a dog had to earn its keep. The plucky terriers did so by tackling rats, badgers, and foxes, entertaining the men by fighting in the pits by night, and working for the women as turnspit dogs by day. Here was a dog with courage to face off against a badger underground and the stamina to run for mile after mile in a turnspit of a hot kitchen. On top of that, the Glen of Imaal Terrier had a sparkling personality that made him part of the family. Some say only a leprechaun could emerge from such a past with such a rosy attitude.Very few turnspit breeds survived into the twentieth century, partly because they weren’t deemed illustrious or intriguing enough to preserve or develop through dog shows. The Glen of Imaal Terrier was largely bypassed in the rush to promote new breeds, allowing it to retain his natural traits rather than evolve into a fashion plate. In 1934 they became one of the first terrier breeds recognized by the Irish Kennel Club. It wasn’t until the 1980s that a concerted effort was made to foster the breed in America. The Glen of Imaal Terrier Club of America was formed in 1986, and the AKC admitted the breed to the Miscellaneous class in 2001. They became a full-fledged member of the Terrier Group in 2004.	A big dog on short legs, the Glen is a dog of big ideas that’s never short of ways to achieve them. This is a spirited, inquisitive, courageous breed, always ready for a game. Less excitable than most terriers, he is nonetheless an active dog. However, once given his daily dose of activity, he is content to snuggle by your side. At home the Glen is good-natured and gentle with family members; with his childlike exuberance, he especially enjoys the companionship of children. Some Glens can be dog aggressive. Glens learn quickly but may not always do what you ask. They are not inclined to bark much.	The Glen is large enough to take part in almost any family activity, and small enough to take almost anywhere. He deals well with inclement weather, but is not a fan of hot weather. The Glen tends to stay around on walks, but because he tends to be fearless in the face of oncoming automobiles or threatening dogs, and loves a good hunt on fresh scent or a good chase, he should not be allowed off lead unsupervised. Glens are not usually great swimmers, and shouldn’t be allowed near deep water until you know they can swim. The coat needs stripping a few times a year, but is otherwise easily maintained.	55	75	22	24
96	Golden Retriever	3	3	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	3	3	3	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	England	1800s	Yellow Retriever	Goldens are athletic, strong and capable of carrying heavy game over land and water, using a broad, powerful head with strong neck and well-developed fore and hindquarters. The breed is slightly longer than tall, with a smooth, powerful, ground-covering gait, and dense, straight or wavy outer water-repellent coat.	One of the best documented and most fortuitous efforts to produce a breed resulted in the Golden Retriever. The man responsible for the breed was Lord Tweedmouth, who lived just north of the Scottish border along the Tweed River. Goldens can reach a weight of 55 – 75 lbs, and a height between 21.5 – 24” A Golden Retriever has a dense, straight or wavy outer water-repellent coat, which sheds heavily twice annually and lightly throughout the year. Groom a Golden Retriever weekly to maintain the double coat and control shedding. The breed was first considered to be a yellow variety of Flat-Coated Retrievers but was recognized as a separate breed, the Yellow or Golden Retriever, in 1912. A few of these dogs had come to America by way of Lord Tweedmouth’s sons by 1900, but the AKC did not register them as a separate breed until 1927. The breed was valued for the hunting abilities so ably produced by the careful blending of foundation stock, and only later became popular as a pet. After the Golden Retriever made the transition, however, this dog’s rise to the height of popularity was meteoric and remains one of the most popular of all breeds in America. Golden Retrievers have a lifespan of 10–13 years. Golden Retrievers are best known to: With an increasing interest in retrieving dogs in the mid-1800s, Lord Tweedmouth bred Nous, a yellow Wavy-Coated Retriever (a descendant of the small Newfoundland and the earlier Labrador breeds used by fisherman) to Belle, a Tweed Water Spaniel (a popular liver-colored retriever with tightly curled coat). The breed pairing produced four puppies, which showed promise of being outstanding upland bird dogs. Subsequent judicious crosses were made with other black retrievers, Tweed Spaniels, setters, and even a Bloodhound.        	 	 	45	80	23	27
97	Gordon Setter	4	4	3	4	2	4	2	3	3	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Setter, Pointer	Great Britain (Scotland)	1600s	\N	The heaviest of the setters, the Gordon is sturdily built and capable of withstanding a long, active day. He needs plenty of rigorous exercise every day to be happy and healthy. The Gordon Setter thrives in a lively, active household.	Black and Tan Setters existed in Scotland at least by the 1600s, but it was not until the late 1700s that the breed became established as the Gordon Castle Setter. The Fourth Duke of Gordon (1743–1827) kept many of these dogs at his Gordon Castle, although most of these were reportedly black, tan, and white. Efforts to breed the finest setters at Gordon Castle continued through the efforts of the Duke of Richmond after the Fourth Duke’s death.Black and Tan Setters, as they were initially named, were shown at the first dog show ever held, in 1859. The name was changed to Gordon Setter in 1924. Gordon Setters are the heaviest and slowest working of the setter breeds, and this distinction was accentuated when Gordons first entered the show ring. In 1875, the trend toward an overly ponderous show Gordon was halted largely through the efforts of one man, Robert Chapman.Unlike many sporting breeds, little division between show- and field-type Gordons exists. Daniel Webster and George Blunt brought the first two Gordons to America in 1842. The dogs, named Rake and Rachael, were obtained from the Duke’s stock and founded the breed in America. The Gordon Setter was among the first breeds recognized by the AKC, receiving the nod in 1892.	The Gordon Setter is a capable, close-working bird dog. He can run all day, and this kind of energy needs a regular outlet or the dog is apt to become frustrated. Gordons make lively, enthusiastic companions, and need the company of lively people. Somewhat more protective than the other setters, he is reserved toward strangers and sometimes aggressive toward strange dogs. He generally gets along well with other family pets. The Gordon has earned its reputation as a devoted family dog.	The Gordon needs much strenuous exercise every day in order to stay in shape. His coat needs regular brushing and combing every two to three days. In addition, some clipping and trimming is needed for optimal good looks.	110	180	21	35
98	Great Dane	2	2	2	4	2	2	4	3	3	1	4	4	Working	Mastiff	Germany	Middle Ages	Deutsche Dogge, German Mastiff	This regal breed combines great size and power with elegance. They are square proportioned and well balanced. The gait is strong and powerful with long, easy strides.  The coat is short, thick, and glossy. The Great Dane is most noteworthy for its majestic carriage and appearance— the Apollo of Dogs.	Dubbed the “Apollo of Dogs,” the Great Dane is probably the product of the ancient Molossus war dog and the Greyhound. With these ancestors, its ability as a fearless big game hunter seemed only natural. By the fourteenth century, these dogs were proving themselves as able hunters in Germany, combining speed, stamina, strength, and courage in order to bring down the tough wild boar. The dogs became popular with the landed gentry not only because of their hunting ability but also because of their imposing yet graceful appearance.These noble dogs made gracious additions to any estate. British familiar with the breed first referred to them as German Boarhounds. Exactly when and why the breed was later dubbed the Great Dane is a mystery because, although undeniably great, it is not Danish. It is a German breed, and in 1876, the breed was declared Germany’s National Dog. In 1880 German authorities declared the dog should be called the Deutsche Dogge, the name by which it still goes in Germany. The English paid no heed, and the old name stuck for the English-speaking world. By the late 1800s, the Great Dane had come to America. It quickly attracted attention, as it does to this very day. The breed has since achieved great popularity in spite of some of the challenges owning a giant dog entails. The record of world’s tallest dog has been held by several Great Danes.	The Great Dane is spirited, courageous, friendly, and dependable. He is generally good with children (although his friendly overtures may overwhelm a small child) and usually friendly toward other household dogs and pets, but like all large dogs should be supervised. With training, he makes a pleasant, well-mannered family companion.	The Great Dane needs daily moderate exercise. His needs can be met with a good walk or romp. He needs soft bedding and sufficient room to stretch out when sleeping. Some tend to drool. Coat care is minimal.	85	115	25	32
99	Great Pyrenees	1	3	2	3	2	3	2	4	1	3	5	5	Working	Livestock dog, Flockguard	France	Ancient times	Pyrenean Mountain Dog, Chien des Pyrenees, Chien de Montagne des Pyrenees	Elegant, imposing, and majestic, the Great Pyrenees is a large dog of medium substance that is slightly longer than tall. The thick coat of the Great Pyrenees gives the impression of heavier bone and stature. This breed was developed to guard flocks on steep mountain slopes and so must combine strength with agility. The dog moves smoothly, with good reach and drive. The weather-resistant double coat consists of a dense, wooly undercoat and a long, flat, coarse outer coat, imparting great insulation from the Pyrenean cold. The  expression of a Great Pyrenees dog is elegant and contemplative.	The Great Pyrenees is a very old breed that probably descended from the first flock guardian dogs, which were large white dogs that existed in Asia Minor about 10,000 b.c. When nomadic shepherds brought their sheep to the Pyrenees Mountains around 3000 b.c, their flock guarding dogs came with them, forming the basis of the Great Pyrenees breed. These dogs excelled as livestock guardians for several centuries. In medieval France, the Pyrenees became a formidable fortress guard, and bands of these imposing dogs became the pride of many large chateaus. In the late 1600s, the breed caught the eye of French nobility. For a brief time they were in great demand in the court of Louis XIV. In fact, in 1675 the Great Pyrenees was decreed the “Royal Dog of France” by Louis XIV. Around the same time Great Pyrenees came to Newfoundland, where they may have played a role in the development of the Newfoundland breed. The first documented Pyrenees came to America with General Lafayette in 1824. By the 1900s, the breed had disappeared from French court life, and the remaining dogs were those found still working in the isolated countryside. Puppies were sold to tourists who brought them back to England and other countries. These dogs bore little resemblance to the magnificent Pyrenees that had once been so admired, however. Interest in the breed declined in England. Fortunately the breed still existed in sufficient numbers and quality in its native mountain land that later fanciers were able to obtain good breeding stock. These dogs served as the foundation of the modern Pyrenees. Serious importation of the breed to America occurred in the 1930s, and by 1933 the Great Pyrenees received AKC recognition. The breed attracted great attention as well as new owners, and today the Great Pyrenees enjoys moderate popularity as a family pet. The breed has earned also a reputation as a reliable livestock guardian in service in much of the United States.	The Great Pyrenees is a capable and imposing guardian. This breed is devoted to its family and somewhat wary of strangers—human or canine. When not provoked, the breed is calm, well-mannered, and somewhat serious. While very gentle with family and children, the Great Pyrenees has an independent, somewhat stubborn, nature.  Because they are wanderers, they should be kept on-leash. As a guardian dog, the Great Pyrenees is a natural barker.	The Great Pyrenees requires daily exercise to stay in shape. A moderate walk will usually suffice. This breed enjoys hiking, especially in cold weather and snow, but does not do well in hot weather. This dog’s coat will require brushing once or twice weekly, daily when shedding. Some dogs of this breed may drool at times, and can tend to be messy drinkers.	85	140	24	29
100	Greater Swiss Mountain Dog	2	3	2	3	3	4	2	3	4	1	4	4	Working	Livestock dog, Mastiff	Switzerland	Ancient times	Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Great Swiss Cattle Dog	The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a strong draft breed. Large and powerful, this breed is slightly longer than tall. The dog’s movement displays good reach and drive. A double coat consists of a thick undercoat and dense outer coat, about 1 to 1¾ inches long. The dog’s expression is gentle and animated.	The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is the oldest and largest of four varieties of Sennenhunde, or Swiss Mountain Dogs, the other three being the Appenzeller, Entlebucher, and Bernese. The breeds share a common heritage, probably derived from the Mastiff or Molossian dogs of the Romans. These dogs were probably introduced when the Romans crossed through Switzerland. Another theory is that the Phoenicians brought them to Spain around 1100 b.c. Whatever their origin, they spread over Europe and interbred with native dogs, eventually developing along independent lines in isolated communities. They shared the same working ethic, dividing their duties between acting as guardian of livestock and home, herder, and draft dog. Many came to be known as Metzgerhunde, or butcher’s dogs. Until the late 1800s, all these dogs, which share a common coat color pattern, were generally assumed to be of one breed or type. Only when Professor A. Heim endeavored to study the native Swiss mountain breeds seriously did he discern consistent differences that allowed them to be categorized as four distinct breeds. The year 1908 can be regarded as the birth date of the Greater Swiss; in this year Professor Heim spotted a magnificent short-haired dog entered in a Bernese Mountain Dog contest. He considered the dog a separate breed, and dubbed it the Greater Swiss because of its resemblance to the sturdy Swiss butcher’s dogs he had also seen. The breed grew very slowly in popularity, additionally thwarted by two world wars. Only in 1968 did the Greater Swiss come to America, with the first litter born in 1970. In 1985 the breed was admitted into the AKC Miscellaneous class, achieving full recognition in 1995.	The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a sensitive, loyal, and extremely devoted family companion. Calm and easygoing, this breed is very gentle with children as well as other pets. However the dog is also is territorial, alert, bold, and vigilant.	As befitting of a dog with working roots, this breed likes the outdoors, especially in cold weather. The dog requires daily exercise, either a good long walk or vigorous romp, and especially enjoys pulling. The coat needs brushing once weekly. More frequent attention is needed when the coat is shedding.	60	70	26	29
101	Greyhound	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	1	4	2	Hound	Sighthound	Great Britain	Ancient times	\N	The ultimate running dog, the Greyhound is built for speed. Long legs and an arched back enable the dog to contract and stretch maximally while executing the double-suspension gallop. Greyhounds have tremendous muscle mass and light legs, further enhancing speed. The feet are long and narrow, giving maximum leverage. The long tail serves as a rudder and brake when running at high speed. The coat is short and smooth. Two registries of Greyhounds are available: AKC (show) and NGA (racing). Retired NGA Greyhounds are smaller, sturdier, and faster than show dogs and, given their past training in racing, may be more inclined to chase small animals.	Sighthounds–dogs that could run after and catch game by outrunning it–were one of first types of dogs selectively bred by humans. The prototypical sighthound has always been the Greyhound. Greyhound-like dogs have been depicted since ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman times. The name Greyhound may come from Graius, meaning Greek, or from the Latin gradus, denoting high grade. By Saxon time, Greyhounds were well established in Britain and were valued by both commoners for their ability to put food on the table and by nobility for the sport of the chase. In 1014 the Forest Laws prohibited all but nobility from keeping Greyhounds near royal forests unless they had been “lamed”; these laws remained in effect for four hundred years. Even when they were repealed, Greyhounds remained the dogs of nobility because with the growing importance of agriculture and domestic animal food sources, the running dog was not economically advantageous. Instead, Greyhounds were used for coursing hare for sport, and during the 1800s coursing became a consuming pastime of the upper class. Early American immigrants often brought Greyhounds with them to the New World. Here they proved adept at coursing on the open plains. When coursing was made available to the masses by staging it first in closed parks and then on tracks after a mechanical lure, the Greyhound’s fate was sealed. Track racing, which began in 1926, proved so popular that dogs were bred specifically for short bursts of speed, ultimately resulting in the fastest breed of dog. Greyhounds continued to compete at dog shows, which they had done since the 1870s. They were AKC recognized in 1885. The breed soon became divided into show and racing types, which were seldom interbred. In America, the Greyhound is one of the least popular breeds according to AKC registrations of show stock. The National Greyhound Association (NGA) registers many thousands of Greyhounds annually; however, recently retired racers from NGA stock have become popular as pets.	Known as “the world’s fastest couch potato,” the Greyhound is quiet, calm, and extremely well-mannered indoors. They are good with other dogs, and with other pets if raised with them. Outdoors, they may tend to chase any small thing that moves. They are reserved with strangers, very sensitive, and sometimes timid. Despite their independent nature, they are eager to please those they trust.	The Greyhound needs daily exercise, but it is a sprinter, not an endurance runner. Give this dog a chance to run in a safe location or provide longer walks on leash. The Greyhound loves to run and chase outdoors, and can easily run into danger at great speed unless exercised in a safe area. Greyhounds relish creature comforts and must have soft bedding and warmth. The coat is extremely easy to care for, needing only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	40	75	21	24
102	Hamiltonstovare	4	5	3	2	3	2	2	2	4	1	1	5	Hound	Scenthound (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Sweden	Late 1800s	Hamilton Hound, Swedish Hound	This agile, versatile Swedish scent hound was originally developed to hunt fox and hare either independently or as a pair in difficult terrain and harsh climates, but also makes for a fine show dog and exceptional family companion. With a short tricolored coat, deep chest and thick tapered tail, the Hamiltonstovare boasts a regal appearance, giving the impression of both strength and stamina.	The Hamiltonstovare was developed in the late 1800s by Count Adolf Patrick Hamilton, founder of the Swedish Kennel Club, to hunt fox and hare in Sweden’s mountainous and forested terrain and harsh climate. The breed was created by crossing English Foxhounds and Harriers, as well as Curlandish Hounds, Holsteiner Hounds and Heiderbrackes, three German breeds that are now extinct. The Hamiltonstovare was first shown in Sweden in 1921 when the breed was known as the Swedish Hound. The name has since been changed to honor Count Hamilton, whose Hamiltonstovare remains popular in Sweden for the traditional hunting purpose for which he was bred. The Hamiltonstovare remains a rare breed in the United States, where he has been recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of its Scenthound Group since 2006 and is part of the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service during the breed’s further development.	Intelligent, focused and driven by both scent and sight, the Hamiltonstovare has a high prey drive. Because such, the breed may not be suitable for homes with other pets that include rodents or small cats. He is friendly, agreeable and even-keeled, not to mention calm and low-maintenance in the home, positioning the breed as a wonderful family companion and excellent service dog.	The Hamiltonstovare’s short, smooth coat sheds seasonally, though only low to moderate, and thus only necessitates minimal bathing and brushing. Regular trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing also are needed. The Hamiltonstovare is an active, energetic breed that can be easily trained and should be thoroughly exercised daily. Because of the breed’s high prey drive, free running or playtime in a fenced area and leashed walks are a must.	35	60	19	21
103	Harrier	4	4	3	3	5	3	4	1	2	1	3	5	Hound	Scenthound	Great Britain	Middle Ages	\N	The Harrier is a smaller version of the English Foxhound, bred to be suited for hunting hares. The Harrier has large bones for its size, and is slightly longer than tall. This is a scenting pack hound was bred to run with other dogs, scenting quarry, and hunting tirelessly over any terrain for long periods. It has a gentle expression when relaxed and alert when aroused. The coat is short and hard.	The word harier was Norman for dog or hound, so that it is difficult to unravel the ancient history of the Harrier from the history of hounds in general. Nonetheless, the Harrier may be one of the older scenthounds still in existence today, with references dating from thirteenth-century England. They probably stem from the long-extinct Talbot and St. Hubert hounds, and perhaps the Brachet and later, the French Basset. This lineage produced a dog that tracked hare by scent at a pace that enabled hunters to follow on foot. Thus, although Harrier packs were kept by the gentry, poorer hunters without horses could also hunt with Harriers, often combining the few dogs each individual had to form an impromptu pack. Smaller English Foxhounds may have been bred with these dogs in the early 1800s to develop a longer legged, faster dog also capable of running with mounted hunters. The Harrier has been known in America since colonial times. Despite this breed’s classic proportions and handy size, it has not been common as a show dog or pet.	The Harrier is somewhat more playful and outgoing than the Foxhound, but not as much as the Beagle. This dog is amiable, tolerant, good with children, and loves to sniff and trail. For that reason, the Harrier needs daily exercise in a safe area or on leash. Most are reserved with strangers. Like many hounds, the Harrier tends to bay, and some may bay or bark if bored or lonely.	The Harrier needs daily exercise, whose needs can be met with a long walk or jog and vigorous play in your yard. The coat is easily cared for, needing only occasional brushing to remove dead hair. Harriers are very gregarious pack hounds and as such do not do well if left alone for long periods. Most are happiest with another dog to play with.	7	13	9	12
104	Havanese	4	3	5	5	4	4	5	1	4	3	3	4	Toy	Barbichon	Cuba	Ancient times	Bichon Havanais	The Havanese is a small, sturdy, short-legged dog with a unique gait that is exceptionally lively and springy, accentuating the dog’s happy nature. The coat is double, with both under and outer coat soft. The profuse outer coat is very long, reaching 6 to 8 inches in length, and ranges from straight to curly, with wavy preferred. The curly coat is allowed to cord. The Havanese has a gentle expression.	The Havanese is one of the Barbichon (later shortened to Bichon) family of small dogs originating in the Mediterranean in ancient times. Spanish traders brought some of these dogs with them as gifts for Cuban women, allowing them to establish trading relationships. In Cuba, the little dogs were pampered as the special pets of the wealthy. They became known as Habeneros, and eventually some found their way back to Europe where they were called the White Cuban. They became quite popular, not only as pets of the elite but also as performing dogs. Their popularity as pets waned, however, and their stronghold remained in the circus, where they performed throughout Europe as trick dogs. Eventually the breed declined in numbers to such an extent that it was almost extinct not only in Europe but also in its native Cuba. A few remained in Cuba, however, and three families with their Havanese left Cuba for the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Most present-day Havanese descend from these dogs. It has gradually aroused attention from dog fanciers and pet owners, and in 1996 the first Havanese entered an AKC show ring, and was accepted for regular recognition as a member of the Toy Group as of the first day of 1999. The Havanese is also known as the Havana Silk Dog.	This is a busy, curious dog, happiest when residing at the center of attention of the family. The Havanese loves to play and clown and is affectionate to family, children, strangers, other dogs, and pets—basically everyone! This breed is willing to please, learns easily, and can tend to be vocal.	Although energetic, the exercise needs of the Havanese can be met with a short walk or a good play session. Coat care entails a full brushing two to four times a week.  This is a non-shedding dog. Loose hairs are caught in the outer hairs, tending to tangle, unless they are combed out regularly.	65	90	25	27
105	Hovawart	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	5	2	2	2	2	Shepherd	Guardian (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Germany	Unknown	\N	The Hovawart is a large, strong and powerful working dog primarily used as a guardian of livestock and property. The breed is well known for its versatility and keen scent ability, positioning him as a suitable guard, watch, tracking and rescue dog, not to mention a devoted family companion. He is recognized for his powerful head, triangular drop ears, deep chest, heavy boning, and well-balanced body that’s longer than it is tall. His long, slightly wavy coat can be black, blond or black-and-gold.	An old German working breed, the Hovawart is primarily used as a yard and farm watchdog. His name originated in the old German language called Middle High German, in which “Hova,” or “Hof,” means yard or farm, and “wart,” or “Wächter,” translates to watchman. The Hovawart nearly became extinct in the early 20th century, but was restored by cross-breedings of German Shepherd Dogs, Newfoundlands, Leonbergers and other similar breeds until the original working type was attained. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale accepted the Hovawart in 1937. The breed was almost lost again during World War II, but was again revived due to various breeding groups’ efforts to sustain the stringent breeding regulations of these hardworking dogs. The Hovawart has been recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of its Guardian Dog Group since 1996 and recorded with the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service since 2010.	Intelligent and naturally protective, the Hovawart thrives on having a job to do, whether guarding the home or livestock, or participating in search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience or agility trials, flyball, or service dog training. Kind and even-tempered, the Hovawart bonds closely with his human family. He should be properly trained and socialized from puppyhood. Because the breed requires a substantial amount of time and attention from his master, the Hovawart is not recommended for rookie dog owners.	Besides the occasional bath and brushing, the Hovawart doesn’t require much grooming. His nails should be trimmed regularly, as should his ears be cleaned and teeth brushed. The Hovawart needs regular exercise — this large breed thrives on room to run, and his preferred exercise would be free play in a large fenced yard, as well as going on hikes and taking trips to the dog park. At minimum, he should be taken on a long walk, as well as several shorter walks, daily.	45	50	23	28
106	Ibizan Hound	3	3	3	2	4	3	3	1	2	2	3	4	Hound	Sighthound	Ibiza (Balearic Islands)	Ancient times	Podenco Ibicenco, Ca Eivissenc, Balearic Dog	The Ibizan possesses a deer-like elegance and expression, with movements that reflect these qualities. A lithe build enables this dog to perform a double-suspension gallop with great speed, agility, and endurance. The Ibizan is a superb jumper, able to spring to great heights from a standstill. The dog has a racy build and is slightly longer than tall. The trot is light and graceful. The coat can be hard, and either short or wire-haired. A wire coat can be from one to three inches in length.	The Ibizan Hound probably shares the same roots as the Pharaoh Hound, bearing uncanny resemblance to the dogs depicted in Egyptian tombs and to the jackal god Anubis. Ancient Phoenician sea traders may have taken the dogs to the Balearic island of Ibiza, where they remained in relative seclusion. Ibiza saw many rulers through the ages, coming under the auspices of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, and, most recently, Spanish. Spanish farmers on the island used them for hunting. With little outside influence, the dogs of Ibiza remain uncontaminated by crosses to other breeds. The hard conditions on the island imposed stringent selection by islanders because only the best rabbit hunters could be allowed to procreate or, for that matter, survive. These factors produced a hardy, true-breeding dog, little changed from ancestral stock. The first Ibizan Hound came to America in the 1950s. The breed’s striking appearance aroused much attention but the dog is not a common pet.  The breed gradually gained enough popularity to gain AKC recognition in 1979, however the Ibizan Hound remains one of the rarer breeds.	The graceful Ibizan Hound retains great hunting instinct, using its acute senses of hearing and smell, and still relishes the opportunity to chase anything that moves.  For this reason, the Ibizan should be exercised in safe areas or on-leash. Unlike most sighthounds, this dog will often bark when chasing and playing. The Ibizan Hound is reserved with strangers and some can be timid. A gentle, mild-mannered, even-tempered dog, the Ibizan is a quiet and loyal house pet.	An independent and athletic dog, the Ibizan Hound needs daily exercise in a safe area. Ideal exercise allows the dog to stretch out at full speed, but exercise needs can also be met with long walks or jogs on leash, combined with an occasional chance to run full out. The Ibizan is a skilled jumper, and this should be taken into consideration when designing an enclosure. The smooth coat requires only occasional brushing, whereas the wire coat requires weekly brushing.	20	40	17	18
107	Icelandic Sheepdog	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	1	4	4	5	5	Herding	Spitz	Iceland	Ancient times	Iceland Spitz, Iceland Dog, Friaar Dog, Íslenskur Fjárhundur	The Icelandic Sheepdog is a Nordic herding spitz with typical pricked ears, a curled, bushy tail, and a double, stand-off coat. These features all help insulate this breed against frigid weather. The breed has two coat types, long and short. Both are double, thick, and waterproof with a fairly coarse outer coat and thick, soft undercoat. The Icelandic Sheepdog is a medium-sized (or slightly under medium) dog, longer than tall. The dog covers ground efficiently when trotting, displaying both agility and endurance.	The Icelandic Sheepdog’s ancestors originated in Norway, journeying to Iceland with Norwegian Vikings in 874—which is why they’re also known as the “dog of the Vikings.” DNA analysis indicates they are closely related to the Karelian Bear Dog of Russia. Once in Iceland, they were used to herd sheep, cattle, and horses.  By the Middle Ages, the dogs became known for their profuse coats and were often exported to England to become pets of the aristocracy. Icelandic Sheepdogs continued to be popular exports to Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and were even mentioned by Shakespeare. Accounts from Iceland up to the twentieth century mention Icelandic Sheepdogs and their various jobs, including herding, finding lost sheep in the snow, rounding up ponies, and gathering puffins. A dog tax imposed in 1869 caused the breed’s population to plummet. Crosses to other breeds almost obliterated the original Icelandic Sheepdog. Iceland banned importation of dogs in 1901, but the first census of Icelandic Sheepdogs located only 20 of the original type. Meanwhile, they were recognized as a breed in Denmark in 1898 and in England in 1905. The breed remained rare, with few typical specimens in Iceland by 1950. Several were brought to America and then England. The Icelandic Kennel Club formed in 1969 to monitor the breed, which was finally seen as part of Iceland’s heritage. The AKC recognized the Icelandic Sheepdog in 2010.	Icelandic Sheepdogs are energetic and alert, ready to play, run, or seek out adventure—preferably at the sides of their people. They are friendly toward all, including strangers, other dogs, and other pets. Although highly responsive, they are also free thinkers—their job often required them to work on their own. If they think they are right they will often ignore commands to the contrary. They have a tendency to bark when alerted or excited.	These active dogs are happiest when they’re on the move and in the cold. They enjoy mental challenges and do well at obedience, agility, and other training activities. They are calm and easygoing inside, even if they miss a day of exercise. Like all double-coated breeds, they shed a lot, especially twice a year. Regular brushing and bathing will cut down on loose hair. The short coat requires about fifteen minutes a week, and the long coat about an hour a week.	60	70	25	27
108	Irish Setter	5	5	5	5	3	3	5	1	3	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Setter, Pointer	Ireland	1700s	Red Setter	A breathtakingly beautiful dog, the Irish Setter’s beauty is in part the result of historical necessity. Its elegant, yet substantial build enabled this breed to hunt with speed and stamina. The build is slightly longer than tall, giving ample room for movement without interference between fore and hind legs. The trot is ground covering and efficient. The coat is flat, straight, and of moderate length, with longer feathering on ears, backs of legs, belly, chest, and tail, providing protection from briars without becoming entangled in them. The rich mahogany color is unique and beautiful.	The precise origins of the Irish Setter are obscure, but the most reasonable theories consider it to have resulted from a blend of spaniels, pointers, and other setters— mostly the English but, to a lesser extent, the Gordon. Irish hunters needed a fast-working, keen-nosed dog, large enough to be seen from a distance. They found their dog in the red and white setters produced from these crosses. The first kennels of solid red setters appeared around 1800. In only a few years, these dogs had gained a reputation for their rich mahogany color. By the mid 1800s, Irish Red Setters (as they were originally known) had come to America, proving themselves as effective game bird hunters. Back in Ireland, around 1862, a dog that was to forever change the breed, Champion Palmerston, was born. With an unusually long head and slender build, he was considered too refined for the field, so his owner ordered him drowned. Another fancier interceded, and the dog became a sensation as a show dog, going on to sire an incredible number of offspring. Virtually every modern Irish Setter can be traced to Palmerston. Interest changed from field trials to dog shows, and emphasis changed from hunting ability to glamour. Despite this, the Irish Setter remained a capable hunter, and dedicated enthusiasts took steps to retain the breed’s dual abilities. The breed increased principally in popularity as a show dog, however, and later as a loyal family pet. It eventually rose to a place among the most popular breeds in America in the 1970s, but has since dropped in popular ranking.	The Irish Setter approaches everything in life with a rollicking, good-natured attitude, full of gusto and fervor. Given a daily outlet for its energy, this breed makes a pleasant companion. Without ample exercise, an Irish Setter can be overly active inside the home, and become frustrated. This is an amiable breed, eager to please and be part of family activities. The Irish Setter is good with children, but can be perhaps be too rambunctious for toddlers.	The Irish needs exercise, and lots of it. It is not fair to take a dog selected for boundless energy and expect it to sit inside. A minimum of one hour of hard strenuous games and exertion a day is recommended. Because of this dog’s energy, the Irish Setter is not suited as an apartment dog. The coat needs regular brushing and combing every two to three days, plus some clipping and trimming to look its best.	25	27	18	18
109	Irish Terrier	3	3	5	2	1	1	2	4	1	4	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	Ireland	1700s	Irish Red Terrier	The Irish Terrier has a graceful, racy outline, with a moderately long body.  Sturdy and strong in substance, the Irish Terrier is also active and lithe in movement. This is an all-round terrier that combines speed, endurance, agility, and power to perform a great variety of jobs. Its broken coat is dense and wiry, and never so long as to obscure the body shape. This dog’s expression, like its nature, is intense.	The quintessential long-legged terrier, the Irish Terrier is also one of the oldest terrier breeds. Its creation is not documented, but the breed may have descended from the old Black and Tan Terrier and a larger but racier solid wheaten-colored terrier, both of which were found in Ireland and used for hunting fox, otter, and other small animals. Similarity to the Irish Wolfhound has led to conjecture that the Irish Terrier may have descended at least in part from that breed. The Irish Terrier has a longer body and longer legs than the other terrier breeds. Early Irish Terriers came in a variety of colors, including black and tan, gray, and brindle. Only near the end of the nineteenth century did the solid red color become a fixture of the breed. The first Irish Terrier was shown in 1875. By the 1880s, the breed was the fourth most popular in England. At that time, it was fashionable to crop the ears of many terriers, but in 1889 the Irish Terrier Club of England banned ear cropping in the breed. The ruling was to have far-reaching implications for all dogs because it instigated the debate about ear cropping and eventually led to the abolition of cropped ears in all breeds shown in England. The breed also became quite popular in America, ranking thirteenth of all breeds in the late 1920s. It was a dominant force in the show rings of the day. In World War I, the breed proved its mettle by serving as a messenger and sentinel. With such an auspicious beginning, the Irish Terrier seemed certain to remain one of the most popular terriers, but it didn’t. Today the Irish is one of the rarer terriers, an uncommon sight in either the show ring or home.	Called the daredevil of Dogdom, the Irish Terrier is brash, bold, assertive, playful, inquisitive, independent, and strong-willed. This breed is ever ready for action and adventure. The Irish Terrier can be aggressive toward other dogs and small animals and tends to be reserved with strangers. This breed likes to chase, run, and explore, and needs daily physical and mental exercise in a safe area. Given sufficient exercise, The Irish Terrier is surprisingly well-mannered and dignified indoors–a loyal and entertaining companion.	This is a dog with an active mind and body. The Irish Terrier needs daily entertainment and exercise as a walking, jogging, and hiking companion. These needs can also be met with a rigorous play session. The wire coat needs combing one or two times weekly, plus scissoring, shaping, and clipping two to four times yearly. Clipping softens the coat and dulls the color.	45	65	21	24
110	Irish Water Spaniel	5	5	5	3	3	3	2	3	5	3	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Spaniel	Ireland	1800s	\N	The Irish Water Spaniel is the tallest spaniel. However, it must never be so large that it can’t be invited onto a boat! The body is of medium length, the whole dog being slightly rectangular in appearance. The general appearance suggests both dash and endurance. The gait is smooth and ground covering. The coat is one of the breed’s distinctive features. The body is covered with a double coat consisting of crisp ringlets. This combination imparts water, weather, and thorn resistance, enabling the dog to work or play in the harshest of conditions. The Irish Water Spaniel’s expression says it all: alert, intelligent, and quizzical.	The Irish Water Spaniel is one of the oldest and most distinctive spaniels. Dogs resembling them are depicted in manuscripts from 1,000 years ago. In the 1100s, mention is made of dogs called Shannon Spaniels, Rat-Tail Spaniels, Whip-Tail Spaniels, or Irish Water Spaniels. Continued references to the Irish Water Spaniel can be found from 1600 on. Around that time, the King of France is said to have been presented with an Irish Water Spaniel. Whether the breed was at one time found in different varieties or whether several similar breeds were its forebears is a matter of conjecture. What is agreed upon is that several similar spaniels existed in Ireland: the Northern Irish, Southern Irish, and Tweed Spaniels. The Southern Irish Spaniel, also called McCarthy’s Breed, is credited with being the eventual major forebear of today’s dogs. In the mid 1800s, the appearance of the prolific sire Boatswain so influenced the breed that he is often credited as being the progenitor of the modern Irish Water Spaniel. The breed entered the show ring in both Britain and America by the late 1800s. In 1875, it was the third most popular sporting dog. Despite its enchantingly clownish appearance and adept water-retrieving ability, the Irish Water Spaniel is now only rarely seen in the show ring or found as the family pet.	The Irish Water Spaniel goes at everything in life with gusto and enthusiasm. This dog loves to swim, run, hike, and play and needs a lot of exercise. A clown at heart, it can be independent, and needs to be trained with patience, firmness, and a sense of humor. The Irish Water Spaniel tends to be reserved with strangers, is sometimes timid, but is generally good with children.	This active, athletic, inquisitive breed needs lots of mental and physical exertion to keep from becoming frustrated or bored. An hour of free-running or strenuous playing a day is necessary to satisfy these needs. Obedience work can also be helpful in providing the mental challenges this dog enjoys. The curly coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week, plus scissoring every few months. Like most dogs, this breed loses its coat periodically; however, the hairs tend to become trapped in the other hairs rather than fall off on their own. If not combed out, they will form mats and cords, so this breed does require attention to grooming.	105	120	30	32
111	Irish Wolfhound	1	3	1	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	5	3	Hound	Sighthound	Ireland	Ancient times	\N	The tallest of the sighthounds, the Irish Wolfhound resembles a rough-coated Greyhound, although of more powerful build. Great size has been especially valued in the breed. This combination of speed, power, and size enabled the Irish Wolfhound to run down and overpower large prey. Despite its size, the breed is gracefully built, with an easy and active gait and a proudly held head. The rough coat, which provides protection against the cold and damp, is especially wiry and long over the eyes and under the jaw.	Dogs of great size are believed to have come to Ireland from Greece by 1500 b.c. In Ireland they became even more imposing, and gifts of these great dogs were made to Rome. The first definite mention of the Irish Wolfhound occurred in Rome in a.d. 391. The breed historically gained fame for its imposing stature and fighting ability. It was so acclaimed in Ireland that it became the subject of many legends recounting its valor in battle and chase. All large hounds were once known as Cu, a term implying bravery. The Irish name for the breed is Cu Faoil. Favored by Irish chieftains for the hunt, it gained its reputation as an unparalleled hunter of wolves and Irish elk. Illustrations of these dogs from the seventeenth century look very similar to modern Irish Wolfhounds. The impressive hounds (often seven at a time) were traditionally given to foreign nobility. This practice, along with the extinction of the wolf in Ireland in the eighteenth century, contributed to the decline of the breed’s numbers. By the nineteenth century, Irish Wolfhounds were almost extinct in Ireland, and the famine of 1845 virtually decimated the breed. In 1869, Captain G. A. Graham determined to resurrect the Irish Wolfhound, a task he set about by crossing the few existing Wolfhounds—in particular one named Bran, thought to be the last true Wolfhound in Ireland— with such breeds as Scottish Deerhound as well as Great Dane, Borzoi, and even Tibetan Wolfdog. When first exhibited at a dog show in the 1870s, the reborn Wolfhound created a sensation—the same reaction it inspires to this day when first seen. Its commanding appearance draws many admirers, but its popularity is tempered by the responsibilities of keeping such a large dog.	Known as the gentle giant, this is an apt description of this soft-natured, easygoing breed. The Irish Wolfhound is calm around the house, sensitive, patient, easygoing, and sweet. Despite its great size, this breed is good with children, pets, and other dogs. He is friendly with strangers, and courageous when the need arises.	The Irish Wolfhound enjoys a long walk and a chance to stretch its legs, so this breed needs daily exercise. At home, ample room is required so the dog can stretch out on a soft surface; this breed should not be required to live in cramped quarters. The dog can develop callouses if required to lie on hard surfaces too often. The coat needs to be brushed or combed once or twice weekly, plus occasional slight scissoring to neaten up straggly hairs. Dead hairs should be stripped around twice a year.	7	14	13	15
112	Italian Greyhound	4	2	3	5	4	4	2	1	3	1	2	3	Toy	Sighthound	Italy	Ancient times	Piccolo Levrieve Italiani	Essentially a slender miniature Greyhound, the Italian Greyhound is exceptionally elegant and graceful. The breed embodies the same qualities that enable the full-sized Greyhound to run at top speed using the double-suspension gallop: a curvaceous outline with a slight arch over the loin and good rear angulation. The gait is high stepping and free. The coat is short and glossy like satin.	The Italian Greyhound has been around for many centuries. Exactly how and when this miniaturized Greyhound was developed has been lost in time. Evidence of dogs resembling the Italian Greyhound can be found in art dating nearly 2,000 years ago from Turkey, Greece, and other areas around the Mediterranean. By the Middle Ages, miniaturized Greyhounds could be found throughout southern Europe, but they found special favor with Italian courtiers. The breed came to England in the seventeenth century, quickly becoming as popular with nobility there as they had been in their Italian homeland. In 1820, the Italian Greyhound was one of only two toy breeds mentioned in a book about dogs. The Italian Greyhound continued to find favor, reaching its peak during the reign of Queen Victoria. After that time, numbers declined and the breed had dwindled to such an extent that it had almost disappeared in England after World War II. One possible reason for the decline was a degradation in quality because dogs were bred for tiny size, often without regard to soundness and health. Fortunately, Italian Greyhounds had come to America in the late 1800s. Even though their numbers were small, they were of excellent soundness. These dogs, along with other imports, helped revive the breed in Europe. Since then, the breed has risen gradually in popularity and is now enjoying a second renaissance.	A sighthound in a small package, the Italian Greyhound shares its larger relatives’ characteristics. This dog loves to run and chase, but is extremely gentle and sensitive. Reserved, often timid, with strangers, the Italian Greyhound is devoted to its family: good with children, other dogs, and pets. Care should be taken, as this small breed can be easily injured by boisterous children and larger dogs.	The Italian Greyhound likes a daily romp outdoors, but dislikes the cold. Exercise needs are best met with a good walk on leash or even a rollicking game indoors. This dog likes to stretch out and sprint in a safe fenced area. Care of the fine short hair is minimal, consisting only of occasional brushing to remove dead hair. Regular brushing of the teeth is important in this breed to prevent future dental issues.	11	13	10	12
113	Jack Russell Terrier	5	5	5	5	3	1	3	2	5	2	2	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	Parson Jack Russell Terrier	The Jack Russell Terrier is a fearless, not to mention tenacious, working terrier, bred to go to ground for work and loves to dig. He’s confident, alert and always ready for work. His weatherproof coat may be broken or smooth; his small, flexible chest helps him pursue underground quarry; and his long legs help him trail fast-running game.  The Jack Russell Terrier is well-balanced with substantial boning, signifying the endurance and strength needed as a hunting terrier.	If you think the Jack Russell Terrier looks familiar, you’re right — the breed has been made famous through the years as Eddie from the hit TV show “Frazier” and as the title character on the PBS program “Wishbone.” Prior to his TV fame, the Jack Russell Terrier was developed in the 19th century as a fox hunting terrier by the Reverend John Russell. There were two strains of the Russell Terrier: the Jack and the Parson. The Jack Russell Terrier was smaller with a longer body and shorter legs as opposed to the Parson Russell Terrier and was used to hunt vermin and bolt rabbits. Today, the Jack Russell Terrier and Parson Russell Terrier are essentially the same breed, with the former being recognized by the United Kennel Club since 2001 and the latter recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1997.	Highly energetic, the Jack Russell Terrier is a clever, bold and friendly little dog. He is a fearless, not to mention tenacious, hunting terrier, bred to go to ground for work and loves to dig. Intelligent, outgoing and active, the Jack Russell Terrier thrives on having a job to do to channel his energy and is best suited for a home environment with a fenced yard where plenty of engaging activity and affection can be given. The breed isn’t highly recommended for a home with toddlers, or other dogs or pets for that matter, due to his independence and lack of patience, but does well with older children.	All that energy has to be burned somehow! Because of his high energy, strong hunting drive and overall zest for life, the No. 1 concern in caring for a Jack Russell Terrier is ensuring he gets ample exercise. His activity should take place on a leash or in a fenced yard to help resist his urge to run off on a prey chase. His short coat, which can be either smooth or broken (rough), requires minimal grooming — regular brushing and the occasional bath is typically all it takes.	4	7	8	11
114	Japanese Chin	3	1	4	5	4	4	5	1	3	3	4	5	Toy	Oriental	Japan	Ancient times	Japanese Spaniel	Small, lively, and aristocratic, the Japanese Chin is a square-proportioned small dog. This breed has a bright inquisitive expression. A small amount of white shows in the inner corners of the eyes, imparting a look of astonishment. The dog’s gait is stylish, lively, and light. The single coat is abundant, straight, and silky, and tends to stand out from the body. The overall appearance is one of Oriental aristocracy.	Despite its name, the Japanese Chin is actually of ancient Chinese origin, probably sharing a close relationship with the Pekingese. Like the Pekingese, the Chin was kept by Chinese aristocracy, and sometimes presented as a gift to visiting nobility. Different stories exist about how it arrived in Japan. Zen Buddhist teachers may have brought them some time after a.d. 520, a Korean prince may have taken some to Japan in a.d. 732, or a Chinese emperor may have presented a pair to a Japanese emperor about a thousand years ago. However the Japanese Chin arrived, it gained great favor with the Japanese Imperial family and was kept as a lapdog and ornament. Portuguese sailors first traded with Japan in the sixteenth century and may have been the first to bring Chins to Europe. The first official record of Chins coming to Europe was in 1853, when Commodore Perry presented a pair from his trip to Japan to Queen Victoria. In the succeeding years, traders brought back many more Chins, selling them in Europe and America. The breed was recognized by the AKC in the late 1800s as the Japanese Spaniel. These early imports were larger than modern Chins, and it is possible that some crossing with English Toy Spaniels may have occurred to reduce size. World War I ended the steady supply of importations, but the breed had already gained a strong foothold. It maintains a modest popularity in America, and still enjoys its greatest popularity in Japan.	The Japanese Chin is a devoted companion, relishing a warm lap as much as a boisterous game. This dog is sensitive and willing to please, often shadowing her owner. The Chin is a friend to all: strangers, dogs, and pets. Playfulness and gentleness make this dog a good child’s companion for equally gentle children. The breed has been described as almost catlike: some even climb!	The Japanese Chin is lively but small enough that exercise needs can be met with a short walk, romp, or game. This dog does not enjoy hot humid weather. Some Chins tend to wheeze. The long beautiful coat needs combing twice weekly.	40	50	17	21
115	Jindo	4	4	4	5	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	Spitz	Northern (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Korea	13th century	\N	With a triangular head, prick ears, harsh straight coat and tail curled over the back, the Jindo is a true Spitz-type breed. This sturdy, medium-size dog is an enthusiastic hunter and fiercely loyal family companion.	The Jindo is believed to have been the result of a cross between dogs indigenous to Korea and dogs brought to Korea by the Mongols during the 13th century invasion. During this invasion, the Korean king surrendered, though some of his armies continued to fight on Jindo Island, off Korea’s southern coast. The dogs belonging to the soldiers became isolated here, where a pure strain of the breed was developed. The Jindo, as the breed became known, gained popularity and was used as hunting and guard dogs in Korea. The Korean government named the Jindo a National Treasure in 1938, and in 1988, the Jindo marched in the Olympics in Seoul. The Jindo was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1998.	Alert, watchful and intelligent, the Jindo is cautious and attentive of his territory. The independent, bold Jindo is faithful toward his master, yet reserved and suspicious with strangers. He’s a polite, attentive housedog and tends to be a one-person type of dog. The Jindo thrives on having a job to do and does best in a fairly active household.	Meticulously clean by nature, the Jindo has a double dirt- and water-repellant coat that requires nothing more than weekly brushing and the occasional bath. Otherwise, he naturally, not to mention meticulously, grooms himself. Keep in mind the Jindo sheds his coat twice a year, which may require more vacuuming or sweeping around the house than usual. Athletic and energetic, the Jindo requires a substantial amount of physical and mental stimulation and excels at dog sports such as lure coursing and agility. Proper socialization and training are a must for this fastidious breed.	20	55	18	22
116	Kai Ken	3	4	3	3	4	2	2	5	3	2	2	2	Spitz	Northern (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Japan	Unknown	Kai	An ancient and rare breed — not to mention one of six native Japanese breeds — the Kai Ken historically has been used as a hunter of big game, such as deer and wild boar, in the mountainous regions of Japan due to his sturdy build, solid muscling and medium size. Because of his high prey drive, few things can slow the agile and keen Kai Ken’s pursuit, as he will readily swim or climb to reach his end game. With his wedge-shaped head, prick ears, tail curled over the back, and harsh coat in a distinct brindle pattern, the Kai Ken is of true spitz type.	An ancient breed that’s still considered rare even in his home country of Japan, the Kai Ken was developed as a big game hunter of deer and wild boar in the province of Kai on the Honshu Island, an area surrounded by mountains and thus geographically isolated. Because such, the breed wasn’t recognized in Japan until 1934. Courageous yet gentle and loyal, the Kai Ken is esteemed as a family companion in the United States. The United Kennel Club recognized the Kai Ken as a member of the Northern Breed Group in 1997, while the American Kennel Club continues to include the Kai Ken in its Foundation Stock Service throughout the breed’s further development.	The Kai Ken is well known as a skilled hunter, devoted companion and trustworthy watchdog. Although the breed is relatively reserved among strangers, he is friendly with his human family and other dogs. The Kai Ken is intelligent, eager to learn and always willing to please his human companion.	The Kai Ken is a naturally clean dog, his double, medium-length coat only requiring occasional brushing and bathing. Keep in mind he’ll blow his coat twice a year, during which time more frequent brushing and bathing is necessary. Other regular maintenance includes nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing. This moderately active breed also requires daily physical and mental activity, such as free running and playtime in a large fenced yard or being taken on several walks. Indoor activities such as games of hide-and-seek, retrieving balls or learning new tricks also will help keep the Kai Ken entertained. Provided his exercise and attention needs are met, the Kai Ken is loving, gentle family companion.	44	49	19	23
117	Karelian Bear Dog	4	4	4	4	1	2	2	3	2	1	2	4	Spitz	Northern (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Europe	1936	\N	The Karelian Bear Dog is a medium-sized, sturdy and silent hunter that marks his game by barking. He’s very in tune with his senses, with an especially keen scent ability, positioning the breed as an exceptional big game hunter. Undoubtedly of the Spitz type, the Karelian Bear Dog has a triangle-shaped head, prick hears and harsh, straight, medium-length double coat with a tail that loosely curls over his back.	Having originated in northwestern Europe, the Karelian Bear Dog first was used by Russian and Finnish peasants as a watch dog and for various types of game hunting. In 1936, the Karelian Bear Dog was bred and developed as a sturdy hunter of large game. Although early dogs were red, red-and-gray, or black-and-white, the latter was the preferred color for the breed’s development. The Karelian Bear Dog standard was written in 1945, and the first specimens were registered under the Finnish Kennel Club the following year. Today, the Karelian Bear Dog stands as one of the top 10 most common breeds in Finland. The United Kennel Club recognized the Karelian Bear Dog as a member of its Northern Breed Group in 1996, while the American Kennel Club continues to recognize the breed as part of its Foundation Stock Service, ultimately designated to become a member of the Working Group.	Loyal and courageous, the Karelian Bear Dog is an eager hunting dog with a high prey drive and works independently yet also cooperatively with his handler. The Karelian Bear Dog tends to territorial toward male dogs, but is friendly, albeit slightly reserved, toward people. Fearless, confident and spirited, the Karelian Bear Dog rarely backs down from a challenge.	To keep the Karelian Bear Dog in prime condition, he doesn’t require much beyond regular weekly brushing and the occasional bath, as well as regular nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing. Moderate exercise also is a must, such as free play or running in a fenced yard or taken on several walks every day, as is mental stimulation, such as indoor games of hide-and-seek, chasing balls or learning a new trick. The Karelian Bear Dog also enjoys swimming, hiking and retrieving balls or flying discs, and is readily trainable for agility, obedience and rally.	35	45	16	19
118	Keeshond	3	3	3	5	3	4	4	1	3	3	4	5	Non-sporting	Spitz	The Netherlands	1700s	Wolf Spitz	The Keeshond is a square-proportioned, sturdy dog of Northern type. An all-purpose dog, the Keeshond is a generalist rather than a specialist, and the physical build reflects this. The gait of the Keeshond is distinctive: clean, bold, and brisk, with only slight to moderate reach and drive. The long straight harsh outer coat stands off from the body, with a good mane and a thick downy undercoat. These impart superb insulation from cold and damp.	The Keeshond (plural: Keeshonden) is one of the family of spitz dogs, although its exact origin is undocumented. The breed seems to have been well established in Holland at least since the eighteenth century as a companion and watchdog. The breed later became known as the barge dog because dogs were often kept as a watchdog on the small vessels navigating the Rhine River. By a stroke of fate, the breed became entangled in the political events of Holland in the years preceding the French Revolution. The leader of the Patriot faction was a man named Kees de Gyselaer, who in turn owned a barge dog named Kees. The dog Kees appeared in so many political cartoons that he and his breed—a dog of the people—became the symbol of the Patriots. Unfortunately for the Keeshond, the Patriots did not prevail, and many Keeshond owners disposed of their dogs lest they be identified with the losing party. To make things worse for the Keeshond, the barges that floated the Rhine became larger, and the small Keeshond became less favored as a barge dog. Nonetheless, the breed did survive, although with a low profile, through the efforts of a few loyal river boatmen and farmers. In 1920, the Baroness van Hardenbroek began an effort to rescue the surviving members. She was so successful at winning friends for the breed that the Keeshond was in England by 1925. AKC recognition soon followed in 1930. So much did the Keeshond recover, the breed is now the national dog of Holland.	The Keeshond combines many traits of the best housedogs: fairly energetic and playful, very attentive and loving, and ready for adventure yet content to take it easy. This breed is sensitive and learns readily. The Keeshond makes a good companion for a child or adult. Friendly to all, this dog is nonetheless an alert watchdog inside the home.	This is a lively breed that can have its exercise needs met with moderate exercise. A good walk on leash, combined with a vigorous game, can satisfy exercise needs. The double coat needs brushing once or twice weekly, and more when shedding.	33	40	18	20
119	Kerry Blue Terrier	3	3	4	3	1	1	3	4	3	5	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	Ireland	1700s	Irish Blue Terrier	This versatile breed has the build of a dog able to perform a variety of tasks, all requiring athletic ability. The Kerry Blue Terrier can run, herd, trail, retrieve, swim, and protect the property from rodents—the ideal all around farm companion. In keeping with this, this terrier is not exaggerated in build. The Kerry Blue is an upstanding, long-legged terrier with a short back, displaying strong bones and muscle. The coat is soft, dense, and wavy, and of a distinctive blue-gray color.	The Kerry Blue originated in the south and west of Ireland, first gaining notice in the Ring of Kerry. Here the dog had been known for at least a century as a versatile farm dog, hunting small game and birds; retrieving over land and water; and herding sheep and cattle. How such a talented and attractive dog should have remained unknown outside of Ireland for so long is a mystery, but it only came on the English and American show scenes around the 1920s. It received AKC recognition in 1924. Early specimens were somewhat disheveled, but as more grooming became accepted, the breed caught on and became a popular show dog. The Kerry Blue is one of the most striking of all dogs. The breed has the peculiarity of being born black, with the blue coloration not appearing until between 9 months and 2 years of age. This terrier is a versatile dog, adding police work and trailing to the list of talents. Despite this, the Kerry Blue Terrier enjoys only modest popularity as a pet.	A versatile terrier, the Kerry Blue’s personality is many-faceted, from hunting and herding, to being just be a fun-loving companion. This dog needs daily mental and physical activity in a safe area. The Kerry Blue loves to run, chase, explore, play, and dig. The dog is well mannered indoors. The breed can be protective toward strangers, and may be aggressive toward other dogs and small animals, yet greets verified friends with great enthusiasm. This breed is clever and independent, and some may tend to bark.	The Kerry Blue needs a good amount of exercise, but these needs can be met with either a long walk on leash, a vigorous play session, or a chance to explore off-leash in a safe area. The coat needs combing about twice a week–more often if around twigs and leaves–plus scissoring and coat-shaping every month.	30	60	17	22
120	Kishu	4	4	3	3	3	1	1	2	2	2	2	2	Spitz	Northern (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Japan	Unknown	Kishu Ken	The Kishu is a medium-sized, well-balanced muscular dog with prick ears and a curled tail, characteristics that suggest his true spitz type. The Kishu’s appearance suggests great endurance, a nod to the breed’s early days as a hunter of wild boar and deer in the mountainous terrain of Japan.	The Kishu is a descendant of the tough, ancient medium-sized Japanese dogs and was historically used to hunt wild boar and deer. The breed was established and developed in the mountainous terrain of Kishu, for which the breed took its name, and was bred in a variety of colors and patterns, such as white, red, brindle and spotted. However, solid colors only were accepted beginning in 1934, and by 1945, the spotted varieties also disappeared. Today, the Kishu’s primary and preferred color is white. Japan designated the Kishu a “Memorial of Nature” in 1934, hence why the breed is rarely exported. The Kishu was recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of the Northern Breed Group in 2006 and continues to be part of the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service during its further development.	Dignified and noble, the Kishu is known to be a faithful, intelligent and docile breed. Energetic yet easygoing, the Kishu is a good fit for an active family, but is also a relaxed and well-mannered house dog. He is reserved among strangers, yet gentle and affectionate with his human companions. Because of the breed’s high prey drive, the Kishu is not recommended for families with small pets, such as cats, but does well with children provided he’s raised with them.	The Kishu doesn’t require much grooming beyond weekly brushing and the occasional bath, as well as regular nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing. He sheds seasonally, during which more frequent brushing may be necessary. The Kishu should be given plenty of daily exercise — free running and playtime in a large fenced yard is ideal to also keep him mentally stimulated. Proper training and socialization are a must, as the Kishu will work independently and do what he wants until taught otherwise.	70	80	26	28
121	Komondor	3	3	3	4	1	4	1	5	3	3	4	5	Working	Livestock dog, Flockguard	Hungary	Ancient times	\N	The Komondor is a large, muscular dog, with plenty of bone and substance, slightly longer than tall. The gait is light and leisurely, with long strides. The hallmark coat is double, consisting of a dense wooly undercoat and a coarser outer coat that is wavy or curly. The undercoat is trapped in the outer coat so that it forms strong, felty, tassel-like cords. This coat helped protect the dog from the elements as well as the teeth of tough adversaries. It also helped the Komondor to blend in with the flock the dog was protecting.	When the Huns came to Hungary, they brought with them the large, long-legged, Russian Owtcharka, which became the progenitor of the Komondor (plural: Komondorok). These dogs bore a close resemblance to the Magyar sheep known as Racka, which had a proud “dog-like” carriage and masses of curly wool. Thus, the dogs easily intermingled with the sheep and at first glance appeared to be one of the flock. Greatly valued by the Magyar shepherds, the Komondorok were not allowed to interbreed with other breeds. The earliest documentation of the breed dates back to 1555, although the breed is certain to have existed long before then. The Komondor earned its keep by guarding the flocks against marauding animals. The breed was so effective, some claim the Komondor is responsible for wiping out the wolf in Hungary. The Komondor was still used as a guard into the twentieth century. The first Komondor came to America in 1933, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1937. World War II almost decimated the breed in Europe, but through the concerted efforts of breed enthusiasts, the Komondor was saved. One of the most impressive dogs to ever grace the show ring, the difficulty of preparing its coat has usually dictated that none but the very finest be shown. As a result, the Komondor remains an uncommon breed everywhere but in its native Hungary. Recent attempts to use the breed as a guardian of flocks in the western United States have yielded promising results, attracting the attention of a new generation of shepherds.	Bred as an independent protector of livestock, the Komondor is true to its heritage. This dog is an independent thinker and can be stubborn or domineering, requiring an understanding and dog-skilled guardian. Socialization is essential. The breed is reserved with strangers and possibly aggressive toward strange dogs. The Komondor is good with other familiar pets and livestock. In fact, this dog is happiest when there is something or someone to watch over. Although usually calm and quiet, the breed is utterly fearless when the need arises. As a natural guardian, the dog is protective of children in its own family, but may at times misunderstand rough and tumble games of visiting children and, as with all dogs, should be responsibly monitored.	The Komondor needs daily exercise in the form of long walks or short romps. Swimming should be avoided due to the time it takes the coat to dry. It may also be difficult to keep the coat clean in some areas. This breed does not like warm weather. The Komondor is non-shedding but not carefree. The cords in the coat must be regularly separated or they will look like flat mats, and the coat also tends to hold dirt. Bathing is time-consuming and drying takes as much as a day. Care of the coat in non-show dogs is far less extensive. Pets can be clipped to make the coat more manageable. It can take a dog up to two years of age before cords form.	70	115	26	30
122	Kuvasz	3	4	3	1	1	4	1	5	1	3	4	5	Working	Livestock dog, Flockguard	Hungary	Middle Ages	Hungarian Kuvasz	The Kuvasz is a large dog, slightly longer than tall, with medium bone. This breed is not bulky, but is light-footed, with a free, easy gait. The breed’s combination of power and agility stems from versatile roots as a guardian, hunter, and herder. The double coat is medium coarse, ranging from wavy to straight.	Although considered a Hungarian breed, the Kuvasz probably descends from giant dogs of Tibet. It came to Hungary from Tibet by way of Turkey. Nor is its name Hungarian, but probably a corruption of the Turkish kawasz, meaning “armed guard of the nobility.” At one time only those nobility in favor with the royal family were allowed to keep one. This is a very old breed. In the latter fifteenth century, the Kuvasz was held in highest esteem. Breeding was carefully planned and recorded, and the dogs were a fixture of most large Hungarian estates. They served as both guard and hunting dog, capable of defending the estate against marauders and hunting large game such as bear and wolf. King Matthias I was a special patron of the breed. In the succeeding centuries, the Kuvasz gradually came into the hands of commoners, who found them to be capable livestock dogs. During this period, the name was corrupted to its present spelling, which ironically, translates as “mongrel.”  The plural form of Kuvasz is Kuvaszok.  After the two world wars, German stock formed a basis for the breed to continue. Some dogs had also been imported to America in the 1930s. The AKC recognized the Kuvasz in 1935.	Despite the gentle appearance, the Kuvasz is a tough protector, fearlessly defending family and home. The breed is gentle with and protective of children in its own family, but may misinterpret a child’s rough and tumble games with other children, and should be responsibly monitored, like all dogs.  The breed is reserved with strangers and may be aggressive toward strange dogs, or domineering, however, they tend to be very gentle with other pets and livestock. The Kuvasz is devoted and loyal but not very demonstrative.	The Kuvasz needs daily exercise and enjoys a long walk or good run in a safe area. This breed especially enjoys cold weather. The dog will do best when allowed access to both house and a safe, protected yard. The coat needs brushing one or two times weekly, and more during heavy shedding periods.	55	80	22	25
123	Labrador Retriever	4	3	5	5	4	5	5	2	5	2	3	4	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	Canada	1800s	\N	The Labrador is a moderate dog, not extreme in any way. It is square or slightly longer than tall, of fairly large bone and substance. The breed’s broad head and strong jaws enabled the dog to carry the largest game birds, such as Canada geese. A heavy body and strong legs enable the dog to swim and run powerfully. The coat, which is short, straight, and dense with a soft undercoat, is weatherproof and helps to protect it from icy waters. The Lab is a working retriever and possesses style without over-refinement, and substance without clumsiness.	The original Labradors were all-purpose water dogs originating in Newfoundland, not Labrador. Not only did the breed not originate in Labrador, but it also was not originally called the Labrador Retriever. The Newfoundland of the early 1800s came in different sizes, one of which was the “Lesser” or “St. John’s” Newfoundland—the earliest incarnation of the Labrador. These dogs—medium-sized black dogs with close hair—not only retrieved game but also retrieved fish, pulled small fishing boats through icy water, and helped the fisherman in any task involving swimming. Eventually the breed died out in Newfoundland in large part because of a heavy dog tax. However, a core of Labradors had been taken to England in the early 1800s, and it is from these dogs, along with crosses to other retrievers, that the breed continued. It was also in England that the breed earned its reputation as an extraordinary retriever of upland game. Initially black labs were favored over yellow or chocolate colors. By the early 1900s, the other colors had become more accepted.  The breed was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1903 and by the AKC in 1917. The popularity of this breed has grown steadily until the Labrador Retriever became the most popular breed in America in 1991 and remains so today.	Few breeds so richly deserve their popularity as does the Labrador Retriever. When trained, the breed is obedient and amiable, and tolerates the antics of children, other dogs, and other pets. The Lab is a calm house dog, playful yard dog, and intense field dog, all on the same day. Labs are eager to please, enjoyslearning, and excel in obedience. It is a powerful breed that loves to swim and retrieve. Labradors needs daily physical and mental challenges to keep occupied. A bored Lab can get into trouble! The Labrador’s hunting instinct can drive a dog to roam, so training and a safe yard are needed.	Labradors are active and sociable dogs. They need daily exercise, preferably in the form of retrieving and swimming. Owners with swimming pools either must fence them out or be prepared to share the pool with dog. The Lab coat sheds water easily. Weekly brushing is needed to remove dead hair.	17	17	14	15
124	Lakeland Terrier	4	3	5	3	1	1	1	1	1	4	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1700s	\N	The Lakeland Terrier is a rather small dog of short-backed, square proportion, with a sturdy, workmanlike build. The legs are fairly long, enabling the dog to run at good speed and traverse the rugged shale terrain of the native mountain countryside. The Lakeland’s gait is smooth and ground covering, with good reach and drive. The body is deep and narrow, allowing the dog to squeeze through small passages. The Lakeland Terrier’s expression reflects moods ranging from intense to gay or impish. The double coat consists of a soft undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat.	The first Lakeland Terriers were kept by farmers who took them along with small packs of hounds in order to control foxes. Although the breed’s background is not documented, it shares common ancestors with the Border Terrier, Bedlington Terrier, and Fox Terrier. As fox hunting became seen as a sport, the terriers became more fashionable as a part of this pursuit. Dogs from the English Lake region were identified as Patterdale, Fell, and Elterwater Terriers, all of which came from the Lakeland region. Only in 1921 were they recognized as Lakeland Terriers, although Cumberland is considered the exact birthplace of the breed. The breed was accepted for AKC registration in 1934. Since then, the Lakeland Terrier has been a prominent contender in the show ring, combining dapper good looks with unsurpassed showmanship. The Lakeland Terrier’s popularity as a family pet has remained moderate.The spunky Lakeland makes the most of every day, always busy investigating, playing, running, and chasing. Given daily exercise in a safe area, this breed settles down in the home and makes an entertaining and endearing house pet. The Lakeland is reserved with strangers and is often aggressive toward other dogs and small animals. Clever and independent, this dog can also be mischievous. The Lakeland Terrier is nonetheless sensitive and must be trained with patience as well as a sense of humor.	This is an active breed that needs daily entertainment or it will make it for itself. A moderate walk on leash or a hardy game in the yard can usually satisfy exercise needs. The Lakeland also enjoys the chance to explore off-leash in a safe area. The wire coat needs combing one or two times weekly, plus scissoring, shaping, and clipping, around four times yearly. Clipping softens the coat and lightens the color.	• Major concerns: none • Minor concerns: lens luxation, distichiasis • Occasionally seen: Legg–Perthes, vWD • Suggested tests: eye, (vWD) • Life span: 12–16 years	9	17	12	12

He is sturdily built, his body slightly longer than it is tall, with a medium-to-high energy level. His short, weather-resistant coat can be either black-and-tan or liver-and-tan, and he carries his tail upward in a slight curve. Aside from driving cattle, the Lancashire Heeler is equally adept at hunting rabbit and rats.	The exact origin of the Lancashire Heeler is shrouded in mystery, though we do know the breed’s been around since the 17th century. The Lancashire Heeler likely can be traced to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and Manchester Terrier, and was used to help drive livestock to the Lancashire market in northern Wales. Aside from his duties as a cattle herder and ratter, the Lancashire Heeler also became well known as a family companion, gaining popularity in the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia. The Lancashire Heeler was placed on The Kennel Club (UK) Endangered Breeds list due to a small gene pool and risk of inherited diseases, such as primary lens luxation. The breed has been recognized by the United Kennel Club as part of its Herding Dog Group since 2009. It also is a member of the American Kennel Club’s Miscellaneous Class. The Lancashire Heeler remains a rare breed today, with only about 5,000 specimens worldwide.	Small but mighty, the Lancashire Heeler a terrier-type working dog.

126	Large Munsterlander	4	5	5	4	5	3	3	3	5	3	2	3	Spaniel	Gun Dog (UKC)	Germany	1919	Large Munsterlander Pointer, Großer Münsterländer	Radiating nobility, strength and refinement, the Large Munsterlander is a talented versatile hunting dog, esteemed for his retrieving, pointing and tracking skills on both land and water, using his wagging, horizontally carried tail to signal game. He has a black-and-white short, smooth, feathered coat, springy gait and keen, far-reaching nose, equally adept for his abilities as a skilled gun dog as he is a cheerful family companion.	The Large Munsterlander was developed in Munster, Germany, having descended from the German Longhaired Pointer and been crossed with various spaniels. A relatively new and rare breed, the Large Munsterlander became popular as a multipurpose hunting companion throughout Europe and was formally recognized in 1919. The breed was imported to the United States in 1966 before being recognized by the United Kennel Club as part of its Gun Dog Group in 2006.	The Large Munsterlander is docile and intelligent, making him easily trainable, though his sensitive nature requires gentle handling. He’s lively and friendly, without being too hyperactive or nervous around strangers. Affectionate and playful, the breed thrives being in the house near his human companions.	This moderately shedding breed requires weekly brushing to his feathered coat, though keep in mind he is a true hunting breed, after all, and should be brushed after every run to remove any field debris he may have picked up. Occasional bathing, nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing is all that remains as far as basic care goes. The Large Munsterlander is lively and energetic, requiring much more exercise than the average family pet. He thrives first and foremost hunting in the field, though also enjoys hiking, running and bicycling with his human companions, as well as free running and playtime in a large fenced yard.	100	170	26	32
127	Leonberger	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	Working	Mastiff	Germany	1900s	\N	The Leonberger is a large, muscular working dog, well suited for the original purpose of family dog, farm dog, and draft dog. The breed is strong and powerful, with medium to heavy build, slightly longer than tall. Males in particular carry a lion-like mane on the neck and chest, and both males and females have a double coat. The coat is medium to long, and the outer coat is medium-soft to coarse, lying flat and is mostly straight. The undercoat is soft and dense. The outline of the body is always recognizable. The Leonberger is light-footed and graceful in motion. The dog has an effortless, powerful, ground-covering gait with good reach and strong drive. An even, confident temperament along with obedience and vigilance is essential to the dog’s role as a family companion.	Leonbergers come from the German town of Leonberg, where they were supposedly bred beginning in the 1830s to resemble the lion on the town crest. The town’s mayor, Heinreich Essig, was a dog breeder and is said to have crossed a Landseer Newfoundland with a “Barry” (precursor to the Saint Bernard), and then a Great Pyrenees. This claim is disputed, however, as there are also descriptions of very Leonberger-like dogs in Austria as long ago as 1585. Further, modern geneticists say more breeds than those three would be needed to produce the traits seen in early Leos. Regardless, Essig was a talented promoter, and he placed his dogs with the celebrities of the day including several royal families. Regular folk also appreciated the breed as all-purpose farm dogs, watch dogs, and draft dogs. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the breed became very popular and commanded a large fee, largely because the breed’s creator gave them to nobility to create a fad for them. During World War I, Leonbergers pulled ammunition carts. Only five Leos survived that war. Only eight Leos survived World War II. All modern Leonbergers trace to these dogs, following a concerted effort by a group of German breeders to rescue them in 1945. Now the breed is popular in Europe, though still fairly uncommon in America. The first Leo came to America in 1971. The AKC recognized the breed in 2010, and it has surged in popularity since. Leos have served as water rescue dogs, trained to leap from helicopters to reach drowning people.	The Leo is a devoted and trustworthy companion, even-tempered, and very affectionate. They are eager to please and fairly easy to train. They are friendly to strangers but also protective of their owners. They are generally good with other pets and dogs, although some can be domineering toward other dogs. Quiet and calm indoors, they are nonetheless good watchdogs.	Leos are more athletic and agile than many of the giant breeds, but they are not good jogging dogs. They enjoy a daily walk or romp and even longer hikes. They also are good at pulling carts, swimming, and search and rescue. The thick coat requires brushing several times a week and daily during shedding seasons. They enjoy cold weather.	13	15	10	11
128	Lhasa Apso	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	4	4	5	Non-sporting	Oriental	Tibet	Ancient times	\N	The Lhasa Apso a small dog, longer than it is tall. Although the breed has never been used for purposes requiring great athleticism, the breed nonetheless has strong loin and well-developed quarters and thighs. The head is well covered with a good fall over the eyes, with whiskers and beard, imparting a dignified, almost lion-like look. The bite should be either level or slightly undershot. The coat is heavy, straight, long, and hard.	The origin of the Lhasa Apso has been long lost; it is an ancient breed bred and revered in the villages and monasteries of Tibet. The breed’s history is intertwined with Buddhist beliefs, including a belief in reincarnation. The souls of lamas were said to enter the sacred dogs’ bodies upon death, thus imparting an added reverence for these dogs. The dogs also performed the role of monastery watch dog, sounding the alert to visitors, thus giving rise to their native name of Abso Seng Kye (Bark Lion Sentinel Dog). It is likely that the breed’s western name of Lhasa Apso is derived from its native name, although some contend that it is a corruption of the Tibetan word rapso, meaning goat (in reference to its goat-like coat).When the breed first came to England, it was known as the Lhassa Terrier, although it is in no way a terrier. The first Lhasa Apsos were seen in the Western world around 1930, with some of the first dogs arriving as gifts of the thirteenth Dalai Lama. The breed was admitted into the AKC Terrier Group in 1935, but it was reassigned to the Non-Sporting Group in 1959. After a slow start, the Lhasa quickly outpaced its fellow Tibetan breeds to become a popular family pet.	Despite its lapdog appearance, the Lhasa is a tough character. The breed is independent, stubborn, and bold. Although eager for a romp or game, this dog will be happy as long as given exercise. The Lhasa will also happily nap beside his or her owner. These characteristics make the Lhasa an excellent small companion in adventure. Although somewhat reserved with strangers, the Lhasa is not an excessive barker.	The Lhasa is an active dog, but a relatively small size means energy needs can be met with short walks or vigorous play sessions in the yard, or even inside the home. The Lhasa makes a fine apartment dog. The long coat needs brushing and combing every other day, always misting the coat first. Bathing every week or two will help prevent mats.	50	95	20	24
129	Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog	5	5	3	4	2	3	2	4	3	1	3	4	Hound	Herding (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Louisiana	Unknown	Catahoula Leopard Dog, Catahoula Cur, Catahoula Hog Dog, Catahoula Hound	A multi-purpose working dog, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog is a moderate breed in all facets: he neither resembles a sighthound nor a bulldog. The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog has a well-muscled, powerful body that’s medium to large in size and just slightly longer than it is tall with a broad head, short coat, drop ears and undocked tail. He gives the impression of agility and endurance. Contrary to his name, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog has many different coat colors and patterns and varied eye colors besides the typical leopard pattern and blue eyes.	Although the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog’s origin is shrouded in mystery, one thing is certain: his versatility and working instinct is unparalleled. Native Americans and Louisiana settlers appreciated the breed for its capability of hunting a variety of wild game, such as deer, bobcat, wild hog and bear, as well as scenting, tailing and treeing game, and baying and herding feral hogs and cattle. The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog is believed to have descended from Native American dogs with bloodhounds, mastiffs and greyhounds brought over by Spanish explorers. The breed’s exotic name, Catahoula, likely is a distortion of the Native American word that meant “Chocktaw,” referring to a local tribe. Regardless of how the breed began, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog became the official state dog of Louisiana in 1979 and was recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of the Herding Group in 1995.	The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog’s temperament spans from one end of the spectrum to the other: He is serious and focused while working, yet energetic and clownish at home. Independent and watchful with natural guarding instincts, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog tends to be wary around strangers. In the company of his human family, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog is an affectionate, gentle and loyal companion.	Beyond weekly brushing and the occasional bath, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog doesn’t require much grooming. His teeth should be brushed regularly, ears checked and cleaned often to remove any buildup of wax or debris, and nails trimmed on a regular basis. The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog thrives on having a job to do as a means to expend his ample energy — without physical and mental stimulation, he can become destructive. Proper training and socialization are a must. He should be given plenty of exercise and attention in a large fenced yard, and thus isn’t suited for city life or apartment living. The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog is an excellent swimmer and also enjoys activities such as hiking and retrieving balls or flying discs.	8	18	12	14
130	Lowchen	4	1	3	3	4	4	3	1	3	4	3	4	Non-sporting	Water Dog, Barbichon	France, Germany	1500s	Little Lion Dog	The Löwchen is a compact small dog, very slightly longer than it is tall, with strong, sturdy—but never coarse—build. The gait is effortless with good reach and drive, and the dog carries head and tail proudly. The coat is dense and long, moderately soft with a slight to moderate wave. The Löwchen traditionally is clipped in a lion trim. The Löwchen has a relatively short, broad topskull and muzzle, and the dog’s expression is alert, bright, and lively.	Löwchen (pronounced Lerv-chun) means “Little Lion Dog,” and in France the breed is known as Le Petit Chien Lion. The Löwchen shares common roots with other members of the Bichon family, which includes the Bichon Frise and Havanese, among others. Germany, Russia, and France have all laid claim to the breed. The exact time and place of origin is obscure, but dogs resembling the Löwchen, sporting the distinctive lion trim, can be found in sixteenth-century German art. In the traditional lion trim, the coat is clipped short from the last rib to and including the hindquarters down to the hock joint. The front legs are clipped from elbow to just above the pastern. The feet are clipped, and about half the tail is clipped, leaving a plume at the tip. Any long hair is to be left unshaped. In the 1960s, the breed’s numbers had dwindled to perilous numbers. Through the efforts of two breeders, several related dogs from Germany were brought to Britain. Because of their small numbers, these dogs were interbred extensively and formed the basis of the breed in Britain as well as America. The Löwchen entered the AKC Miscellaneous class in 1996 and was admitted as a member of the Non-Sporting Group in 1999.	This is a lively, inquisitive, affectionate dog. The Löwchen is a mixture of playful spirit and calm soul mate–a good companion for a quiet family. This breed is willing to please and  is responsive to commands, as well as being devoted to the family. Some enjoy barking or digging.	The Löwchen can receive ample exercise with a short walk or active game every day. This breed enjoys a mental challenge. The coat needs brushing or combing about every other day. Clipping to maintain the traditional lion trim must be done every month or two. Many pet owners prefer to keep their dogs in a puppy clip.	4	6	9	11
131	Maltese	4	1	4	3	3	3	1	1	3	3	4	5	Toy	Barbichon	Malta	Ancient times	Bichon Maltiase	Even though the Maltese is best known for a beautiful coat, this dog’s body structure, facial expression, and overall carriage are essential components of the type. The Maltese is a diminutive dog with a compact, square body, covered all over with long, flat, silky, white hair hanging almost to the ground. The expression is gentle yet alert. This is a vigorous dog, with a jaunty, smooth, flowing gait. The well-built Maltese seems to float over the ground when trotting.	The Maltese is the most ancient of the European toy breeds, and among the oldest of all breeds. The island of Malta was an early trading port, visited by Phoenician sailors by 1500 b.c. Maltese dogs are specifically mentioned in writings as early as 300 b.c. Greek art includes dogs of Maltese type from the fifth century on. There is evidence that they even erected tombs to favored Maltese. Although the dogs were often exported and subsequently widely distributed throughout Europe and the Orient, the core population on Malta remained relatively isolated from other dogs, resulting in this distinctive dog that bred true for centuries. Though the Maltese’s hallmark is its long, silky, dazzling white hair, early Maltese came in colors other than white. By the early fourteenth century, Maltese had been brought to England, where they became the darlings of the upper-class. Writers of the succeeding centuries continually commented upon their diminutive size. Still these little dogs were never commonplace, and an 1830 painting entitled “The Lion Dog from Malta—Last of His Race” suggests that the breed may have been in danger of extinction. Soon after, two Maltese were brought to England from Manila. Although originally intended as a gift for Queen Victoria, they passed into other hands and their offspring became the first Maltese exhibited in England. At this time, they were called Maltese Terriers, despite the lack of terrier ancestry or characteristics. In America, the first Maltese were shown as Maltese Lion Dogs around 1877. The name lion dog probably arose from the habit of dog fanciers, particularly those in the Orient, of clipping the dogs to look like lions. The AKC recognized the breed as the Maltese in 1888. The Maltese slowly increased in popularity, and now it ranks as one of the more popular pet toy breed dogs.	Long a favorite lapdog, the gentle Maltese fills this role admirably. The Maltese also has a wild side, and loves to run and play. Despite the innocent look, this is bold and feisty pup who may challenge larger dogs, and some enjoy barking. The Maltese is reserved with strangers.	The exercise requirements of the Maltese are easily met with indoor games, a romp in the yard, or a short walk on leash. The coat needs combing every one or two days. Show coats may be “wrapped” for protection. The white coat may be difficult to keep clean in some areas. Pets may be clipped for easier care.	12	22	15	16
132	Manchester Terrier	4	3	4	4	3	1	1	1	2	1	2	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1500s	Black and Tan Terrier	The Manchester Terrier is one of the sleekest of all terriers, with a smooth, compact, muscular body, slightly longer than tall, and a slightly arched topline.  The coat is smooth and glossy. The Manchester’s gait is free and effortless. The dog has a keen and alert expression.	One of the most popular and accomplished terriers of early England was the Black and Tan Terrier, mentioned as early as the sixteenth century. The Black and Tan was a skilled dispatcher of rats. With the advent of industrialization, sport of the working class in England’s towns centered around rat catching with Black and Tans and dog racing with Whippets. It was only a matter of time before the two breeds were crossed, with the goal of creating a dog that could excel in both arenas. The result was a refined black and tan terrier with a slightly arched back. Similar crosses had almost certainly been made in other regions because other dogs resembling this new strain were not uncommon, but the breed’s popularity centered around Manchester. In 1860, the breed was formally dubbed the Manchester Terrier. The name did not catch on, and it was dropped in favor of Black and Tan Terrier, only to be revived in 1923. Until 1959, Standard and Toy Manchesters were shown as two separate breeds. In 1959, they were reclassified as one breed with two varieties.	The Manchester Terrier has been described as “catlike,” being impeccably clean, independent, reserved with strangers, yet sensitive. This breed is more responsive than many terriers and is generally a well-mannered house dog. The Manchester is devoted to its family, and enjoys napping at with a special person.. Otherwise, this is a busy breed,  ever nosing around for adventure, a game, or digging.	The exercise needs of this alert and active breed can be met with a moderate walk on leash, a good romp in the yard, or an off-lead foray in a safe area. Coat care is minimal.	77	100	25	30

Resembling a polar bear, the Maremma Sheepdog’s long, harsh white- or cream-colored coat helps him blend well with the sheep he’s guarding. He has a large, flat head, triangular ears, deep chest and low-set tail. The Maremma Sheepdog’s body is of heavy build, and is slightly longer than it is tall.	\N	\N	\N	175	190	28	30
134	Mastiff	1	2	1	4	3	4	2	4	3	1	4	5	Working	Livestock dog, Sheepdog, Mastiff	England	Ancient times	English Mastiff	The massive Mastiff is heavy boned with a powerful musculature, being slightly longer than tall. Great strength is combined with endurance. Power and strength are evident in this dog’s gait, which has good reach and drive. The double coat consists of a dense undercoat and a straight, coarse, outer coat of moderately short length. The expression is alert but kindly. The overall impression is one of grandeur and dignity.	The Mastiff is the prototypical breed of the ancient mastiff group of dogs. The confusion between the Mastiff breed and the mastiff family makes it very difficult to trace the history of the breed. Even though the mastiff family is one of the oldest and most influential in dogdom, the breed is undoubtedly of more recent, though still ancient, origin. By the time of Caesar, mastiffs were used as war dogs and gladiators. In medieval times, they were used as guard dogs and hunting dogs and became so widespread as to become commonplace. Kubla Khan is said to have kept 5,000 Mastiffs for hunting in the 1200s. Mastiffs later stepped into the arena of dog fighting, bull baiting, and bear baiting. Even when these cruel sports were banned in England in 1835, they continued to be popular events. The modern Mastiff descends not only from these pit dogs but also from the lines of nobles, being descendants of one of the most famous Mastiffs of all time: the Mastiff of Sir Peers Legh. When Sir Legh was wounded in the battle of Agincourt, his Mastiff stood over him and protected him for many hours through the battle. Although he later died, the Mastiff returned to Legh’s home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. Five centuries later the Lyme Hall Mastiffs figured prominently in founding the modern breed. Some evidence exists that the Mastiff came to America on the Mayflower, but the breed’s documented entry to America did not occur until the late 1800s. The breed was nearly decimated in England by World War II, but sufficient numbers had been brought to America by that time to keep the breed going. Since that time, it has gradually risen in popularity.	The Mastiff is innately good natured, calm, easygoing, and surprisingly gentle. It is a well-mannered house pet but needs sufficient room to stretch out. This is an extremely loyal breed, and though not excessively demonstrative, the Mastiff is devoted to his or her family and is good with children.	The adult Mastiff needs daily moderate exercise, consisting of either a good walk or an enjoyable game. The Mastiff is prone to drooling. Coat care is minimal. This breed does not enjoy hot weather.	25	33	10	14
135	Miniature Bull Terrier	4	3	5	2	2	3	3	3	1	1	3	5	Terrier	Terrier, Mastiff, Bull	England	1800s	\N	Minature Bull Terriers are strongly built, square-proportioned dogs, big boned but not coarse. They reflect the attributes of the standard-sized Bull Terrier, such as sturdy bone and muscle and strong jaws. Their gait is free and easy. Their skin is tight and coat is short, flat, and harsh. They wear a keen and determined expression on its characteristic clown face.	The Miniature Bull Terrier comes directly from the Bull Terrier and so shares the breed’s early history. In the early days of the Bull Terrier, the standards allowed for a great range of weights, reflecting the great range in size of the Bull Terrier’s ancestors: the Bulldog, White English Terrier, and Black and Tan Terrier. Smaller Bull Terriers have long been a part of the breed, with some weighing as little as 4 pounds being recorded early on. These smallest white Bull Terriers were at one time called Coverwood Terriers. However, there was more interest in the slightly larger dogs, the miniatures rather than toys.By 1939, the Miniature Bull Terrier was recognized by the English Kennel Club, but the breed never gained popular attention and grew only slowly. In 1991 it was recognized by the AKC. Still an uncommon breed, but this dog is bound to increase in popularity as a true miniature version of the popular Bull Terrier.	Very much like the larger Bull Terrier, the Mini is comical, lively, playful, and mischievous. Despite the smaller size, this is not a lap dog. Mini Bull Terriers are every bit as tough as the larger version and apt to want to prove themselves even more. They are sweet clowns, devoted but not fawning. They are stubborn and independent and need to be trained with a firm yet gentle hand— and a good sense of humor. They like to play and investigate. They like to dig, and they need ample exercise.	The Mini’s exercise needs are daily, but not excessive. They need either a moderate walk or a romp in a safe area. They can do well as an apartment or city dog. Coat care is minimal.	11	11	5	6
136	Miniature Dachshund	4	2	3	3	3	2	1	2	2	2	3	5	Hound	Scenthound	Germany	1500s	Zwergteckel	The Dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. The Dachshund’s long low-slung body once enabled them to enter and move freely inside the confines of a den or tunnel. Their confidence, keen nose, and loud voice also are common traits of this breed. Their gait is fluid and smooth.	Definitive evidence of the Dachshund as a breed isn’t found until the sixteenth century, when reference was made to a “low crooked legged” dog called a Little Burrow Dog, Dacksel, or Badger Dog. The modern name “Dachshund” means simply badger (dachs) dog (hund) in German.The Dachshund comes in three coat varieties and two sizes. The original Dachshunds were smooth coated and arose from crosses of the Bracke, a miniature French pointer, with the Pinscher. Some evidence exists of longer-haired Dachshund-like dogs in sixteenth-century woodcuts. It is also possible that smooth Dachshunds were later crossed with spaniels and the German Stoberhund to produce the long-haired variety. Mention is made of wire-coated Dachshunds as early as 1797, but most modern wires were created around the end of the nineteenth century by crossing smooth Dachshunds with German Wire-haired Pinschers and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.Before 1900, very small Dachshunds were kept to protect the home and farm from rodents. Although some were simply runts, others were intentionally produced by crosses with toy terriers or pinschers. Most of the resulting miniatures lacked Dachshund type, however. By 1910, stricter criteria were adopted for type, and each coat type was crossed with different breeds to achieve the best results: smooths were bred with the Miniature Pinscher, longs with the Papillon, and wires with the Miniature Schnauzer. The Dachshund has since found its real niche as a family pet, steadily rising in popularity to hold a place as one of the most popular hounds in America.	The Dachshund is bold, curious, and always up for adventure. They often like to chase and dig, or scent related games or activities. They can be independent but will join in their family’s activities whenever given a chance. The Dachshund can be good with children in his own family, but some may need to be carefully introduced to strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The long-haired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.	Although active, the Dachshund’s exercise requirements can be met with moderate walks on leash and games in the yard. They are amenable to city life or apartment living, but are energetic at heart and enjoy time outside. The smooth coat requires minimal grooming. The long coat requires brushing or combing once or twice weekly and occasional trimming of stray hairs. The wire coat requires brushing or combing about once a week, with occasional trimming of stray hairs and stripping to remove dead hair twice a year.	8	10	10	13
137	Miniature Pinscher	5	2	5	3	2	1	1	1	1	1	3	5	Toy	Pinscher	Germany	1600s	Reh Pinscher, Zwergpinscher	The Miniature Pinscher is athletic, spirited, and among the most energetic dogs. Despite their name, the Miniature Pinscher or “Min Pin” is not a miniature version of the Doberman Pinscher. In fact, the Min Pin is the older of the two breeds.	Clues about the Miniature Pinscher’s origin are scarce, but it is noteworthy that a cat-sized red dog resembling a Min Pin is depicted in a seventeenth century painting. By the nineteenth century, several paintings include dogs of distinct Min Pin type. These dogs probably resulted from crossing a small short-haired terrier (German Pinscher) with the Dachshund and Italian Greyhound.Many of the traits from these breeds can be seen in today’s Min Pins: the strong body structure, feistiness, and black and tan coloration of the German Pinscher; the fearlessness and red coloration of the Dachshund; and the elegance, playfulness, and lithe movement of the Italian Greyhound. Yet the Min Pin is more than the sum of its parts; it is perhaps the world’s most energetic breed!These little German spitfires were developed into a distinct breed, the “reh pinscher” in the early 1800s, so named because of their resemblance to the small red German roe (reh) deer. Pinscher simply means terrier. The breed quickly became one of the most competitive and popular show dogs in pre-World War I Germany, but after the war, the breed experienced a plunge in numbers. Its future was left to those dogs that had been exported before the war. Its popularity continued to grow in America, and it received AKC recognition in 1929. Dubbed the king of toys, the Min Pin slowly accumulated admirers and is presently one of the more popular toy breeds in the United States.	Among the most energetic of all breeds, the Min Pin is a perpetual motion machine. He is busy, inquisitive, playful, bold, and brash. He retains terrier-like traits and tends to be stubborn and independent. He can be scrappy with other dogs and may chase small animals. He is reserved with strangers but affectionate to his family.	The Min Pin needs lots of activity. Because of his small size, his exercise needs can be met indoors or out; regardless, he needs several play sessions every day. He hates the cold. His coat is virtually carefree, requiring only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	12	18	10	15
138	Miniature Poodle	4	3	5	4	4	3	4	1	5	5	3	5	Non-sporting	Water Dog	Germany, Central Europe	1500s	\N	The Poodle is a square-proportioned dog with proud carriage and elegant appearance. They often move with a light, springy, effortless stride. The Poodle breed stems from working retriever origins, and their build reflects their athletic background. Their coat is curly and dense, forming a water resistant barrier.  Poodle often appear active, intelligent, and elegant. They have a proud bearing and air of distinction.	Although the Poodle is most often identified with France, their earliest ancestors were probably curly-coated dogs from central Asia that assisted with herding and followed many routes into various parts of Europe. Interwoven in their ancestry are also several rough-coated water dogs. Perhaps the earliest incarnation of the Poodle was the Barbet, a curly-coated dog found in France, Russia, Hungary, and elsewhere. It is the German version, however, that exerted most influence on the modern Poodle. In fact, the word poodle comes from the German word pfudel, meaning puddle or “to splash,” probably reflecting the dog’s water abilities. In France, they were known as caniche or chien canard, both referring to their duck-hunting abilities.The Poodle was also drawn into service as a military dog or guide dog. Their coat was shorn close to facilitate swimming, but left slightly longer on the chest for warmth in cold water. Although some believe the puffs of hair around the leg joints and tail tip were for protection, other evidence suggests that they arose as decoration during the Poodle’s performing days. The Poodle found favor as an elegant companion for fashionable ladies. They became favored by French aristocracy and eventually became the national dog of France.Poodles began to find more popularity in the late 1800s. Some of the early Poodles were shown in corded coats, in which the hair is allowed to mat in long thin tresses rather than be brushed out. While eye-catching, the upkeep was difficult, and the trend died out by the early 1900s, being replaced by the bouffant styles. At the same time Poodle popularity in America waned, so that, by the late 1920s, Poodles had almost died out in North America. In the 1930s, the breed staged a comeback that eventually placed it as the most popular dog in America for decades.	The Miniature Poodle is often lively, amiable, playful, eager to please, responsive, smart, and obedient—small wonder that they have remained one of the most popular varieties of dog for so long. They are often sensitive, tending to be devoted to one person, and initially reserved with strangers. They can be good with children, other pets, and dogs. Some tend to bark a lot.	All Poodles need a lot of interaction with people. They also need mental and physical exercise. A brief but challenging agility or play session, combined with a walk, should be part of every Poodle’s day. Standard Poodles will need more exercise and may especially enjoy swimming. They should preferably be brushed every other day or weekly for shorter coats. Poodle hair, when shed, does not fall out but becomes caught in the surrounding hair, which can cause matting if not removed. Clipping their coat can be easier to maintain and can be done every four to six weeks.	13	15	12	14
139	Miniature Schnauzer	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	5	Terrier	Schnauzer	Germany	1800s	Zwergschnauzer	The Miniature Schnauzer is a robust, sturdily built terrier of nearly square proportion. Historically, they were developed to protect the home and farm from rodents and they are often quick and tough. Their gait displays good reach and drive. The Miniature Schnauzer’s coat is double, with a close undercoat, and hard, wiry, outer coat which is longer on their legs, muzzle, and eyebrows. Their facial furnishings add to their keen expression.	The smallest and most popular of the Schnauzers, the Miniature Schnauzer originated in the late 1800s as a small farm dog in Germany. In fact, the Miniature Schnauzer is the only terrier not originating from European Isle breeds. The breed began by mixing the Standard Schnauzer with the Affenpinscher (and possibly Poodle) to produce a smaller dog more adept at protecting the home and farm from rodents.All the Schnauzers get their name from one individual dog named Schnauzer who lived around 1879—an apt name, since Schnauzer means small beard. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer was in 1888. The Miniature Schnauzer was recognized as a breed distinct from the Standard Schnauzer by 1899 in Germany. The AKC recognized the Miniature (once called Wirehaired Pinscher) in 1926. Most Miniature Schnauzers today trace back to a single dog named Dorem Display, born in 1945. The Miniature Schnauzer is the only Schnauzer to remain in the Terrier Group in America.In England they join the other Schnauzers in the Utility Group. The Miniature Schnauzer came to America long after their Standard and Giant counterparts, but in the years after World War II, they far outpaced them in popularity, eventually rising to become the third most popular breed in America at one time. The Miniature Schnauzer remains as a perennial favorite, a smart looking and alert family pet.	The Miniature Schnauzer deserves their place as one of the most popular terrier pets. They are often playful, inquisitive, alert, spunky, and companionable. They are a well-mannered dog that also enjoys being in the middle of activities. They tend to be less domineering than the larger Schnauzers and may get along with other dogs more than most terriers. They are also better with other animals than most terriers, although they may gladly give chase. The Miniature Schnauzer is clever and can be stubborn, but they are generally biddable. They often enjoy children and some may bark a lot.	This energetic breed can often have their exercise requirements met with a moderate walk on leash or a good game in the yard. Their wire coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus professional grooming every couple of months. Clipping can soften the coat texture.	30	60	16	26
140	Mountain Cur	4	4	3	3	2	2	2	5	4	2	2	4	Hound	Scenthound (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	United States	1900s	\N	The Mountain Cur is a powerful, courageous and strong-willed hunter that tracks his game by scent. He is an agile, muscular, medium-sized treeing dog with a clear, loud bark that can be heard from a long distance out, especially when he’s hot on a trail.	A true all-American pioneer dog, the Mountain Cur is a relatively new breed, having only been declared a breed in 1957. Prior to that, the early settlers used these dogs to guard family and livestock against wild animals and other intruders on the rugged frontier in the mountains of what is now Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee. The Mountain Cur also was used to track and tree wild game as a source of the family’s food. Frontiersmen also used the wild game as a means to provide for their families by selling the furs for money. Although the breed’s exact origin is unknown, as the pioneers didn’t document the Mountain Cur’s pedigrees, the Original Mountain Cur Breeders of America formed upon declaration of the breed in 1957, and the United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1998.	Intelligent, loyal and dependable, the Mountain Cur bonds closely with his owner and considers his primary duties to protect and please his human family. The Mountain Cur can be reserved with strangers, but responds well to training provided he’s been well-socialized with plenty of human interaction. The breed also makes for a wonderful family companion and watchdog.	The Mountain Cur has a short, dense, tightly knit coat that’s fairly easy to care for. Occasional brushing to remove any dead or loose hair, as well as occasional bathing, will keep his coat in tiptop shape. Keep in mind he sheds twice a year, during which more frequent brushing is essential. He should also receive regular nail trimming and ear cleaning. This active breed should be exercised frequently, such as being taken on long daily walks, to keep him physically and mentally engaged. Intelligent and eager to please, the Mountain Cur also enjoys participating in performance events and other outdoor activities and sports. The breed tends to be stubborn and territorial, so a firm pack leader is needed, as well as early training and socialization to ensure he’s well-mannered around people and other pets.	110	150	24	31
141	Neapolitan Mastiff	2	1	1	4	1	2	1	5	2	2	5	5	Working	Mastiff	Italy	Ancient times	Mastino Napoletano	With its massive size made even more imposing by its abundant loose skin and dewlap, the Neapolitan Mastiff may have the most alarming appearance of any dog, and some say this look was purposefully bred in order to scare away intruders without the dog having to act. However, when forced to act, the Neo can spring into action with surprising speed. Its massive muscular body can knock down almost any intruder. Its huge head with short, powerful jaws and large teeth can crush or hold an opponent. The skin is tough and hanging, adding to the imposing impression of size as well as formidable expression.	Heavy-bodied dogs with powerful grips have been known since ancient times, tracing to the giant war dogs of the Middle East and Asia. They were used to control livestock, guard homes, or even fight men, lions, and elephants in battle. Around 330 b.c. Alexander the Great dispersed some native giant Macedonian war dogs in the lands he conquered, and crossed some with shorthaired dogs from India. The resulting Molossus became the progenitor of many modern breeds. When the Romans took over Greece they also took their Molossus dogs. In 55 b.c. the Romans invaded Britain, where they admired and appropriated fierce British mastiff dogs that fought valiantly in defending Britain. These British mastiffs were even better gladiators than the Molossus dogs, but when bred together they produced an unsurpassed strain of giant gladiators and war dogs. These dogs, called “mastini” (Italian for mastiffs), were dispersed further. In the Neapolitan area in the south of Italy, they were perfected over the next centuries for guarding estates and homes. Still, the breed remained virtually unknown to the rest of the world until a chance sighting at a Naples dog show in 1946. Piere Scanziani recognized the dog and solicited other fanciers to help rescue the breed from obscurity. They drew up a standard and petitioned the Italian kennel club and the FCI to recognize them under the name Mastino Napoletano. Although a few specimens may have come to America with Italian immigrants, only in the 1970s has the breed been documented in the United States. They immediately elicited great interest and a breed club was formed around 1973. An initial standard was approved by the AKC in 1996, and they entered the AKC Working Group in 2004.	The Neapolitan Mastiff was bred for centuries to guard its family. As such, it is incredibly loyal and devoted to its family, watchful and suspicious of strangers, and tolerant of acquaintances. It is a stay-at-home-type dog. Although it is loving toward children, its sheer size can make accidents possible. It may not get along well with other dogs, especially domineering-type dogs. Because of its size, it should be carefully socialized at an early age.	Neos don’t need a lot of exercise, but they do need a lot of living space. They enjoy the outdoors but do not tolerate warm weather well. As with any giant breed, food, boarding, and even veterinary bills can be higher. They drool and can leave a trail of food and water leading from their bowls. This is not a breed for obsessive house cleaners!	100	150	26	28
142	Newfoundland Dog	2	2	3	5	4	5	5	4	3	3	5	3	Working	Livestock dog, Mastiff, Water dog	Canada	1700s	\N	The Newfoundland is a large, heavily boned, powerful dog, strong enough to pull a drowning man from rough seas. The dog’s appearance is both huggable but imposing. This breed is slightly longer than it is tall. The gait gives the impression of effortless power, with good reach and drive, and the double coat is a soft, dense undercoat with a coarse, moderately long and straight outer coat. The dog’s soft expression reflects its benevolent and dignified temperament.	As its name suggests, the Newfoundland was developed on the coast of Newfoundland. Here the agreement about its origin ceases. Although it ultimately traces back to the Tibetan Mastiff, no actual record exists of Tibetan Mastiffs being brought to Newfoundland. Some authorities believe that it descends from the Tibetan Mastiff by way of the Great Pyrenees. In 1662, the first permanent colony at Roougnoust was settled, complete with Great Pyrenees dogs. These dogs were crossed with black English retrievers belonging to English settlers. Some Husky blood may also have been introduced. Whatever the ingredients, the result was a massive water-loving, cold-resistant dog found in either solid black or black and white coloration. The latter “Landseer” Newfoundland was only identified in 1779. The Newfoundland name predates it only by a few years, named after an individual dog called Newfoundland. The Newfoundland distinguished itself as an all-purpose water dog, hauling heavy fishing nets through the cold water and saving many people from watery graves. Its work didn’t stop on dry land; here it served as a draft dog and pack animal. European visitors were so impressed that they returned to Europe with many specimens, and it is here that the breed first entered the show ring. The export of dogs from Newfoundland, along with laws forbidding ownership of more than one dog, drove the breed’s numbers down in its place of origin. The breed’s stronghold switched to England, and American fanciers resorted to replenishing their stock with English dogs. After World War II, the tables turned, and American Newfoundlands were responsible for reviving the decimated English stock. Recovery in both countries is now complete, and the Newfoundland is one of the more popular of the giant breeds of dogs. Although the solid black color is most identified with the breed, the black and white Newfoundlands (dubbed Landseers after the well-known artist who first portrayed them) are also popular.	The most important single characteristic of the Newfoundland is sweetness of temperament. The Newfoundland is calm, patient, easygoing, gentle, and amiable—a friend to all. If its family is threatened, however, the Newfoundland can act protectively.	This easygoing dog needs daily exercise to stay fit, either in the form of a moderate walk or short romp. It loves to swim and pull, especially in cold weather. Some breeders contend that Landseers tend to be more active than solids. It does not do well in hot weather. Its coat needs combing twice weekly, more when shedding. Newfs do drool and also tend to be messy drinkers.	11	12	9	10
143	Norfolk Terrier	4	3	3	1	3	3	3	1	2	3	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	\N	Unlike the Norwich Terrier, the Norfolk is slightly longer than it is tall. Like the Norwich, this dog is a small alert dog who historically protected home and farm from rodents, working alone or in a pack. the Norwich Terrier is small, short-legged, and compact, with good bone and substance. The gait is low and driving. The double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat consisting of hard, wiry, straight hair about 1.5 to 2 inches long, with a longer ruff. This dog wears a keen and intelligent expression and is a loyal companion.	The Norfolk Terrier shares an identical early history with the Norwich Terrier. During the development of these breeds, both prick and drop ears were seen, and neither could lay claim to being more authentic or original than the other. In the 1930s, soon after their entry into the show rings, breeders found that crossing the two types of ear carriage resulted in uncertain ear carriage in the offspring, so they began avoiding crossing the two ear types. The prick-eared type were more numerous; in fact, the drop-eared type almost vanished during World War II. The drop-eared strain owes its existence to the single-handed and determined efforts of Miss Macfie of the Colansays. In the 1940s, breeders came to her to renew breeding the drop-eared type of Norwich, and they soon caught up with the prick-eared type in popularity, although not in show awards. Eventually, amid some controversy, the breed was officially changed from one breed with two varieties to two separate breeds. This happened in 1964 in England and in 1979 in the United States.	Feisty, bold, inquisitive, game, scrappy, stubborn, and independent, the Norfolk is all terrier. It has been called a “demon” in the field, and it loves to hunt, dig, and investigate. It must be exercised in a safe area. It is clever and amiable but strong willed.	The Norfolk Terrier needs an exercise outing every day, either a short to moderate walk or a lively and boisterous play session. It especially likes to hunt and investigate, but it must do so in a safe area. It does best as a housedog with access to a yard. Its wire coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus stripping of dead hairs three to four times yearly.	26	40	16	19
144	Norwegian Buhund	5	5	5	5	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	5	Herding	Spitz	Norway	Ancient times	Norsk Buhund	The Buhund is a typical northern breed of the spitz type, with erect ears, full and curled tail, and double coat—all of which protect the dog against the cold. The breed has a square build, with moderate substance and bone, and is slightly less than medium sized.  They are quick and sure-footed; their herding style is that of a loose-eyed upright breed, with a natural tendency to circle and gather. The gait is free and effortless, and temperament alert, self-confident, and lively. The outer coat is thick and hard but rather smooth. The undercoat is soft and dense.	Remains of spitz-type dogs have been found in Norway’s oldest archeological sites and in Viking grave sites from 900 a.d. The dogs traveled with the Vikings and were buried with them to continue their various duties in the afterlife. Today’s Buhund is the direct descendant of these dogs. The name Buhund roughly translates to farm (or homestead or mountain hut) dog. In many areas, every farm had one to herd and watch over sheep, cattle, pigs, reindeer, and various small livestock. Shepherds spent summers in mountain huts with their dogs to help control and watch the stock. The land was rocky, with steep slopes, and the dogs had to work on their own to gather stock, often finding and flushing them by barking. During shearing, they could walk over the sheeps’ backs to get from one side of a flock to the other. The Buhund remained an essential part of Norwegian farm life for centuries, until the importation of other breeds diminished their population in the early 1900s. The breed was first exhibited in agricultural shows in 1913. In the 1920s, Buhund shows were held with state-run sheep and goat shows, rekindling interest in the breed. The Norsk Buhund Club was founded in 1939. The Buhund came to England after World War II, and later, to America. The Norwegian Buhund Club of America was formed in 1983. The Buhund became a member of the AKC Herding Group in 2009.	Affectionate, cheerful, and full of energy, the Buhund is a great companion for active families. They are eager to please and are considered one of the easier to train spitz breeds, although they are still somewhat independent thinkers. This breed likes to keep busy and if not given plenty of work or play, they can devise games that may not be acceptable. They are excellent watchdogs but can be overly exuberant barkers.	Buhunds are active and playful. They need a good workout every day in the form of a long jog or energetic activities such as retrieving, agility, or especially, herding. Given sufficient exercise, they are calm indoors, although prone to bark. The coat is medium to short but double. It sheds freely (especially twice a year) but does not tangle. Brushing a few times a week, plus regular bathing, will keep shed hair down.	48	55	20	21
145	Norwegian Elkhound	4	3	4	3	2	2	4	2	3	2	4	3	Hound	Spitz, Northern	Norway	Ancient times	Elkhound, Norsk Elghund	A typical northern spitz-like breed, the Norwegian Elkhound is a square-proportioned, close-coupled dog, with substantial bone, broad head, pricked ears, and a tightly curled tail. This dog is constructed for agility and endurance rather than speed. The Elkhound has a thick, smooth-lying coat consisting of straight outer hairs and a wooly undercoat. This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow.	The Elkhound is an unusual hound because its roots lie in the spitz breeds, which the breed still closely resembles. The placement in the Hound Group reflects partly the misinterpretation of the original “hund” name as “hound,” but mostly because the breed is functionally a scenthound. Historically this dog used tracking abilities to hunt moose and other large game. The Elkhound has served as a hunter, guardian, herder, and defender at least since the time of the Vikings. In a land of subzero temperatures, deep snow, thick forests, and rugged mountains, only the hardiest of breeds could evolve to perform the variety of jobs at which the Elkhound excels. Although the breed had been carefully bred for centuries, only since the late 1800s were pedigrees kept. The breed has been exhibited in Scandinavian dog shows since that time and was brought to England and America shortly thereafter. The breed gained the American public’s attention when President Hoover was given an Elkhound as a gift from Norway in appreciation for his help in World War I. The AKC recognized the breed around 1930, and the Elkhound has enjoyed moderate popularity since then.	The Norwegian Elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, and boisterous. This is a dog ready for adventure and is happiest if that adventure takes place outdoors in cold weather. Daily exercise is needed to prevent frustration or destructive behavior.  Friendly with strangers, this dog may still quarrel with unfamiliar dogs. Families thinking of adding an Elkhound to their household should expect to train this playful dog not to pull on a leash, and be tolerant of barking.	The Elkhound was developed to hunt all day under grueling conditions and therefore needs daily exertion in order to feel satisfied. This can be in the form of a good jog, a very long walk, or invigorating play session. The double coat needs brushing twice a week, and daily during main shedding season.	13	16	12	15
146	Norwegian Lundehund	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	5	Non-sporting	Spitz	Norway	1500s or earlier	Puffin Dog	The Lundehund uses strong extra toes to help grasp rocky cliffs and to dig under boulders. This dog is flexible and can bend the head backward so the top of the head touches the back. The Lundehund can also extend the forelegs straight out to either side, which results in a peculiar rotary movement when the dog trots. This dog can close the ear openings to block out debris and has elongated rear foot pads for better traction. The breed also has two fewer teeth than other dogs. Otherwise, the general conformation is typically spitz. The Lundehind is neither coarse nor heavy and is instead athletic and agile, with a medium-length double coat that has a harsh outer coat with soft underfur.	It’s the world’s most flexible dog and the only dog to have six toes on each foot. These traits have helped the Lundehund perform a dangerous job for hundreds of years. Lundehund means Puffin Dog in Norwegian. The Lundehund comes from Norway’s Lofoten Islands, where puffin birds (“lundes”) nest in narrow caves and tunnels in the islands’ cliffs. Only the Lundehund could climb the cliffs and squeeze deep into the twisting tunnels to catch these birds when they were hunted. Distemper, a dog tax, and crosses with other breeds rendered the pure Lundehund almost extinct. In the 1960s, interest in the breed grew with a breed club, and numbers grew under the guidance of a geneticist who devised a breeding program to repopulate the breed. The first Lundehund came to Canada in 1960 and to America in 1987. The Norwegian Lundehund became a regular AKC breed in 2010.	Lundehunds are more primitive in their behavior than many breeds, very inquisitive and independent. They are free thinkers, which can be challenging when training. They can climb and tunnel, so few things are out of their reach. They have a strong prey drive but can get along with other pets if raised with them. They are very alert and may bark a lot. Most tend to be reserved with strangers but not aggressive. They normally protect by barking rather than biting. If not socialized extensively as puppies, they can be sound-sensitive or shy.	Lundehunds are busy dogs, climbing on things and checking out crannies. They need a good walk or vigorous play session every day. They particularly enjoy the chance to explore new places or any activity that engages their active minds. Some can be difficult to housetrain. Coat care consists of a weekly brushing; more often when shedding. A dog with symptomatic Lundehund syndrome can present feeding challenges and needs a special diet.	12	12	10	10
147	Norwich Terrier	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	\N	This spirited dog, one of the smallest of the working terriers, is sturdy and stocky, of square proportion. Historically, the breed’s small size and large teeth were an asset when following game down tight passageways. The double coat has a hard, wiry, and straight outer coat that lies close to the body and is thicker around the mane for protection. The dog bears a slightly foxy expression.	Short-legged ratting terriers have long been valued in England, but only in the 1880s did the breed that would eventually become both the Norwich and Norfolk Terriers emerge from obscurity. At that time, owning one of these small dogs became a fad among Cambridge University students. The little terriers became known as CanTab, and later Trumpington, Terriers. Around 1900, a Trumpington Terrier named Rags came to a stable near Norwich. He sired countless offspring and is the patriarch of the modern Norwich. One of his sons came to America and proved to be an amiable ambassador for the breed. To this day, many people still refer to the Norwich as the “Jones” Terrier, after this dog’s owner. The AKC recognized the breed in 1936.	The Norwich Terrier, like the Norfolk, is a true terrier at heart, always ready for adventure and excitement. This dog may chase small animals, given the breed’s hunting background. The Norwich is a pert, independent, amusing—but sometimes challenging—companion, best suited for people with a sense of adventure and humor.	The Norwich needs a good walk or short run every day. This dog especially likes combining a run with a chance to explore, but any such off-leash expeditions must be done only in a safe area. The wiry coat needs combing one to two times weekly, plus grooming of dead hairs three to four times a year.	35	52	17	21
148	Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever	5	5	5	5	5	5	3	2	4	2	3	2	Sporting	Gundog, Retriever	Nova Scotia	1800s	Little River Duck Dog	Because Tollers run as much as they swim when “tolling,” they are smaller and more agile than most other retrievers. Their powerful yet compact build enables them to rush around tirelessly, leaping and retrieving with tail always wagging. Because they were bred to work in icy waters, they have a water-repelling double coat of medium length. A longer coat is not appropriate for a working dog, although the tail feathering should be long, adding to the emphasis of the wagging tail. A white blaze, chest, tail tip, or feet is characteristic.	Europeans used dogs to toll (Middle English meaning: to lure or decoy) ducks into nets since the seventeenth century. Tolling is done by the dogs frolicking along the shore, chasing sticks, and occasionally disappearing from sight, an activity that draws curious ducks to the area. Such decoy dogs may have come with European settlers to the New World, where they were used to toll from the Chesapeake Bay to the Maritimes. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever was developed in Yarmouth County, at the southern tip of Nova Scotia, in the early nineteenth century. Originally known as the Little River Duck Dog or the Yarmouth Toller, the breed later became known as the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. It was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1915, with 15 Tollers registered that year. The first Tollers came to the United States in the 1960s.  In 2001 Tollers were admitted into the AKC Miscellaneous class, and were admitted as a regular member of the Sporting Group in 2003. Since then they have proven they are more than just tollers or retrievers, but excel at obedience, agility, tracking, and of course, companionship.	As befitting a dog bred to play and retrieve tirelessly, the Toller is very energetic and playful. You cannot throw a ball just once for a Toller! Everything they do is done with gusto, whether it’s obedience, agility, or just walking around the block. They are alert but not hyperactive, and can adjust to many circumstances. They are affectionate and gentle, but young Tollers can be overly boisterous at times. They are good with children, other dogs, and pets. Tollers may be initially wary of strangers, but warm up quickly. They learn fast and are generally willing to please, but bore easily and then can be a bit stubborn. When excited, they can be very vocall and are known for the shrill “Toller scream.”	Tollers need lots of exercise, especially involving playing and retrieving. They love water! Tollers also profit from mental challenges, such as obedience and agility. They are devoted family companions that treasure their interaction with humans. Grooming consists of a thorough weekly brushing.	60	90	21	22
149	Old English Sheepdog	3	3	3	5	3	5	4	3	2	4	4	3	Herding	Livestock, Herding	England	1800s	\N	This is a square-proportioned, thick-set dog, combining agility with strength. The compact body of the Old English Sheepdog is broader at the rump than shoulders. A distinguishing characteristic is the topline, which is lower at the withers than the loin. The gait is free and powerful, ground covering, yet gives the appearance of being effortless. The dog may pace or amble at slower speeds. The ambling gait is sometimes described as a “bearlike” roll or shuffle. The coat is profuse, but not excessive. It consists of a waterproof undercoat and a hard, shaggy outer coat that is neither straight nor curly. The dog has an intelligent expression.	The Old English Sheepdog originated in the west of England, possibly from the Bearded Collie or Russian Owtcharka. The breed was the answer to the need for a strong dog capable of defending the flocks and herds from the wolves that existed at one time in England. By the middle of the nineteenth century, these dogs were used mainly to drive cattle and sheep to market. As working dogs, they were exempt from dog taxes, but their tails had to be docked as proof of their occupation. This custom continued in modern times and has led to their nickname Bobtail. The Old English was recognized by the AKC in 1905. Popularity as a pet was slower to grow, until the 1970s when the breed became a favorite media animal. The breed’s popularity exploded with pet owners wanting an exotic but lovable mop. Since then, the breed’s numbers have gradually declined, but the OES still remains well-known. The Old English is now more often seen as a pet or show dog than a working dog.	The amiable Old English is jolly but gentle. At home, the dog is a well-mannered house pet that often amuses the family with comical antics. The breed thrives on human companionship and is very much a homebody. Extremely devoted to the family and protective of family members, this dog will tend to children as flock members, and is generally friendly toward strangers. Some can be headstrong.	The Old English Sheepdog needs daily exercise, either a moderate to long walk or a vigorous romp. The breed of course particularly enjoys herding. The coat needs brushing or combing every other day or it may form mats.	80	115	24	27
150	Otterhound	2	3	3	5	3	3	5	1	2	3	4	4	Hound	Scenthound	England	Ancient times	\N	The Otterhound is a large dog with a somewhat stocky build, slightly longer than tall, not exaggerated in any way, enabling the dog to trot at a slow steady pace for long distances without tiring. The coat, which consists of a rough, coarse outer coat combined with a soft wooly slightly oily undercoat, is essential for protecting the dog from brambles and cold water. The breed has a fairly large nose and muzzle, allowing ample room for olfactory receptors. The large feet provide traction over rough and slippery terrain. This is a strong athletic breed that can withstand harsh weather and long strenuous hunts. The dog’s expression is open and amiable, reflecting a friendly temperament. The Otterhound is noted for its steadfast pursuit of quarry despite the roughest of conditions. The breed has an acute sense of smell and can trail unerringly through running water and over all sorts of terrain.	The Otterhound is one of the most unusual members of the Hound Group–a hardy, tousled scenthound of uncertain origin. The breed may have originated in France, and closely resembles the old French Vendeen hound. Other breeds that may have played a part in its origin were the Welsh Harrier, Southern Hound (a foxhound-like breed), Bloodhound, or a type of water spaniel. Whatever the genetic makeup, the Otterhound came to fill a unique niche as a hunter of otters in England and is thus most associated with that country. King John kept the first documented packs of Otterhounds in 1212. Otterhunting was never among the most popular of sports, reaching its peak during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and essentially died out after the Second World War. The first Otterhound came to America at the beginning of the twentieth century and was recognized by the AKC soon after. Otterhound aficionados have been especially adamant that the breed retain the functional characteristics, without succumbing to exaggerated grooming practices or the temptation to breed only for a competitive show dog. Even though this practice has maintained the true Otterhound type, the breed has never been especially popular as a show dog or pet. Despite the fact that the Otterhound is one of the most ancient of the English breeds, it is one of the rarest of English Kennel Club or AKC recognized breeds, verging perilously close to extinction.	As a packhound, the Otterhound is amiable with other dogs. Once on the trail, it is determined, single-minded, and nearly impossible to dissuade from its task. Even though the Otterhound’s job was not to kill its quarry, it will nonetheless give chase to small animals. The Otterhound loves to sniff, trail, and, especially, swim. At home this dog is boisterous, amiable, and easygoing (although stubborn), affectionate with the family, and quite good with children. Because the Otterhound was never traditionally kept as a pet, the dog is not among the most responsive of breeds. However, the Otterhound is a low-key dog that is a quiet companion.	The Otterhound needs daily exercise in a safe area or on a leash. The dog has a loud, melodious voice that carries for long distances. The Otterhound’s coat requires only weekly brushing or combing. The beard may need to be washed more frequently. Tidiness is not one of this dog’s virtues; the large, hairy feet tend to hold debris and mud, and the long hair around the mouth can hold water and food.	4	9	8	11
151	Papillon	4	1	5	5	4	4	4	1	5	3	3	5	Toy	Spaniel, Companion	France	1500s	Epagneul Nain, Phalene, Continental Toy Spaniel	The Papillon is a small, dainty, elegant dog of fine-boned structure, slightly longer than tall. The gait is quick, easy, and graceful. The abundant coat is long, silky, straight, and flowing. The dog’s hallmark characteristic, besides the friendly temperament and alert expression, are the breed’s beautiful butterfly ears.	The name Papillon is French for butterfly, which the face and ears of this spritely little dog resemble. The Papillon has roots in the dwarf spaniels so popular throughout Europe from at least the sixteenth century. These little dogs were extremely popular with the nobility; as time went on, Spain and Italy became the centers of dwarf spaniel breeding and trading. The court of Louis XIV of France was particularly fond of these little dogs and imported many of them. At one time the Papillon was known as the Squirrel Spaniel because the plumed tail was carried over the back in the same way a squirrel does. These early dogs had drooping ears, but through some unknown event, some dogs sported erect ears. Both drop- and erect-eared Papillons could be found in the same litter. Even today both ear types are equally correct, although the erect-eared dog is more well-known. In America, the drop-eared Pap is known as the Phalene, which is French for moth, whereas in Europe it is called the Epagneul Nain or Continental Toy Spaniel. The Papillon has become one of the more popular toy dogs, functioning equally well as a loving pet, beautiful show dog, and adept obedience and agility competitor.	One of the most obedient and responsive of the toy breeds, the vivacious Papillon is also gentle, amiable, and playful. The breed is friendly toward strangers, other dogs, and pets. The dog is very good with children but due to the small size can be injured by rough play. Some can be timid.	The lively Papillon thrives on mental stimulation, and enjoys a daily walk on leash as well as challenging games indoors or out. The coat needs brushing twice weekly.	13	17	12	14
152	Parson Russell Terrier	5	4	5	3	2	1	3	2	3	3	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	Parson Jack Russell Terrier	Parson Russell Terriers are slightly taller than they are long and have a medium build. The PRT’s expression is often keen and full of life. Historically, their slender build also allowed them to fit into small passageways when protecting the home or farm from rodents. The Parson Russell Terrier has a gait is free and lively, with good reach and drive. Their coat can be either smooth or broken, both coarse and weatherproof with short, dense undercoat. The outer coat of the smooth is flat and hard; that of the broken is straight, tight, and close lying.	Parson Russell Terriers descend in most part from a dog named Trump, who was acquired by the Parson John Russell of Devonshire, England, in the mid 1800s. John Russell was a hunting enthusiast, and he sought to develop a line of terriers that could keep up with the horses. His line was so successful that they eventually carried his name. Although John Russell became extremely active in the English Kennel Club, for some reason he declined to show his own breed in dog shows. This tradition holds true even today.After heated debates, the breed was nonetheless admitted into the Terrier Group in 1998. Jack Russells have long been popular with horse owners and are frequently seen around stables, but the type of terrier more often seen there has short legs and a long body. The term Parson was added to distinguish the traditional long-legged terrier. In 2003, the AKC-recognized dogs had their names changed from Jack Russell Terrier to Parson Russell Terrier. The Parson Russell Terrier has become a popular media dog, and their exposure caused great interest in the breed. As a result, their numbers grew. As irresistibly cute as they may be, they are definitely not a breed for everyone.	This is a dog that thrives on action and adventure. In the process, they may find themselves in the middle of trouble. They are very energetic and if given the chance, will explore, wander, chase, and dig. The Parson Russell Terriers is often very playful and intelligent. They often get along well with children and strangers. They may need to be properly introduced to strange dogs, but they are usually better than many terriers. They can do well with horses, but may chase cats and are not good with small pets. They may tend to bark and dig. Parson Russell Terriers can make an ideal companion for an active person with a good sense of humor who wants a lot of entertainment— and perhaps some mischief—in one dog.	Most Parson Russell Terriers need a lot of mental and physical stimulation every day. They are not a dog that can sit around inside. They need a long walk or strenuous game every day, plus a short training session. They often enjoy the chance to explore on their own, in safe areas. Coat care for the smooth type consists only of weekly brushing to remove dead hair; the broken coat may require occasional professional grooming.	11	13	10	15
153	Patterdale Terrier	4	5	4	4	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	Terrier	Terrier	England	Unknown	Lakeland Terrier	This working terrier breed is treasured for his tenacity and courage, not to mention his endless desire to go to ground and his willingness to please. The Patterdale Terrier is sturdy, tough and active with a compact and balanced body. His small, flexible chest allows him to squeeze through tight spaces to pursue quarried vermin, while his strong neck, powerful jaws and teeth help him hold his game at bay.	The Patterdale Terrier originated in Northern England, having descended from the black, smooth-coated Fell Terrier. The Fell Terrier was used to control vermin that preyed on sheep and were bred to bolt the quarry out of its den. These tough-as-nails hunting characteristics were passed down to the Patterdale Terrier. Today, not only does the Patterdale Terrier continue to excel at hunting, but also in agility and racing. The United Kennel Club recognized the Patterdale Terrier in 1995.	Eager to please with a hardworking attitude, the Patterdale Terrier is determined, active and courageous with a high prey drive. Affectionate and gentle, he fares well with humans, livestock and other dogs due to his relatively laidback nature. The Patterdale Terrier is intelligent and sensitive, and with plenty of training with positive reinforcement, is a well-behaved companion.	As a true working terrier, the Patterdale Terrier requires plenty of exercise and playtime in a securely fenced yard. His dense, coarse, weatherproof double coat may be smooth, broken or rough, and should be brushed weekly and bathed every couple of months.	14	14	6	9
154	Pekingese	1	1	1	2	3	4	2	1	1	5	5	5	Toy	Oriental	China	Ancient times	Lion Dog, Peking Palasthund	The Pekingese is a compact dog with a pear-shaped body, heavy forequarters and lighter hindquarters, slightly longer than tall. The dog’s image is lion-like and implies courage, boldness, and self-esteem rather than prettiness, daintiness, or delicacy. The gait is dignified and unhurried, with a slight roll resulting from the wider, heavier forequarters. The undercoat is quite thick and the outer coat is long, coarse, straight, and stands off, forming a mane around the shoulders. The Pekingese looks suggest the breed’s Chinese origins in the lion-like appearance, bold and direct character, and distinctive expression.	The Pekingese owes its existence to the Lamaist form of Buddhism in China, in which the lion was an exalted symbol of Buddha, sometimes appearing in miniaturized form. The Foo dogs then in existence bore some resemblance to a lion and were carefully bred to accentuate this similarity. In fact, these dogs eventually came to be known as lion dogs. At the height of their favor (during the T’ang dynasty from a.d. 700 to a.d. 1000) many of these lion dogs were literally treated as royalty, pampered by personal servants. Smaller Pekingese were called sleeve dogs because they could be carried in the large sleeves of their Chinese guardians. In 1860, the imperial summer palace was looted by the British. Among their loot were five royal lion dogs, which were taken back to England. One was presented to Queen Victoria and, along with the other four, caused such interest among dog fanciers that there arose great demand for more of these dogs.  The Pekingese was extremely popular in the late 1900s but has since fallen greatly in numbers.	The Pekingese is decidedly not a timid lapdog. The breed has a courageous character that will not start a fight but will not back down from one. The dog tends to be aloof around strangers but this is not a breed-wide trait. Many are outgoing and loving, but are independent and not overly demonstrative. The breed’s stubbornness is legendary. Although playful around family members, the dog may not be athletic or playful enough to satisfy many children. The breed will not tolerate rough handling by children, and can be injured by careless hard play.	The Pekingese enjoys a leisurely walk outdoors, but is equally happy to romp inside. The breed is susceptible to heat prostration and must be kept in air conditioning in warm weather. The Peke is an ideal apartment dog. The coat will mat unless combed at the very least weekly, preferably more often. The overnose wrinkle should be cleaned daily to avoid infection. The coat around the anus must be inspected daily for soiling. Pekingese tend to snore!	27	27	10	12
155	Pembroke Welsh Corgi	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	3	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Wales	1100s	\N	The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is moderately long and low, less heavily boned than the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. The dog’s movement is free and smooth, with good reach and drive. This is a breed that needs to be quick and agile, even after herding all day, in order to avoid the cattle’s kicking hooves. The breed combines a weather-resistant undercoat of medium length with a coarser outer coat of slightly longer length. The expression is intelligent and interested, foxy, but not sly.	The Corgi was an essential helper to the farmers of South Wales. Although these little dogs specialized in herding cattle, nipping at their heels and then ducking under their kicking hooves, they were almost certainly also used in herding sheep and even Welsh ponies. Despite claims for the antiquity of the breed, it is difficult to trace the origins or even authenticate the breed’s existence in early times. A Welsh cattle dog is mentioned in a book of the eleventh century, however. Although the breed certainly shares its past with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, the Pembroke was developed separately, in Pembrokeshire, Wales. As a hard-working dog, the Corgi was out in the fields when many of the early dog shows were being held. Only in 1926 did a club form and the breed enter the show ring. The obvious differences between the Pembroke and Cardigan were troublesome to judges—the Pembroke is smaller, with sharper features, a more foxlike expression, and characteristically no tail. In 1934, the Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis were divided into two separate breeds, after which the Pembroke soared in popularity. Its appeal was heightened when it became the favorite of King George VI and, subsequently, Queen Elizabeth II. By the 1960s, the Pembroke had become one of the most popular pet breeds all over the world, especially in Britain. This popularity has since waned slightly, but far more Pembrokes can be found herding in backyards than in farmyards today.	Quick and quick-witted, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has an active mind and body. This breed needs daily physical and mental exercise. The dog is devoted and willing to please, fun loving, amiable, and companionable. The breed is very good with children, although may nip at heels in play. This dog is usually reserved with strangers. Many enjoy barking.	The Pembroke loves to herd, and a daily herding session would be ideal to meet exercise requirements. The dog can do fine without herding, however, as long as there is a moderate walk on leash or a good play and training session off-leash. Coat care consists only of brushing once a week to remove dead hairs.	84	110	23	26
156	Perro de Presa Canario Dog	2	3	3	3	1	1	1	5	2	1	2	2	Molossoid	Guardian (UKC)	Spain	15th century	Canary Dog of Prey	Powerful, agile and courageous, the Perro de Presa Canario gives the overall appearance of a powerful, stately guard dog with a large, robust body that’s slightly longer than it is tall. He has a broad, deep chest with a large head and thick, elastic-like skin.	The Perro de Presa Canario can be traced back to its ancestors, likely brought to the Canary Islands by the Spanish Conquistadors in the 15th century, where they lived among the indigenous cattle dogs. Whether guarding farms, catching cattle or eliminating wild or stray dogs, the Perro de Presa Canario was a dog of many purposes. The breed began to decline in the 1940s, but was revived again in the 1970s by reputable breeders who developed and bred the Perro de Presa Canario to its original size and character.	Confident and strong-willed, the Perro de Presa Canario is suspicious of strangers and can be aggressive toward other dogs, with a firm, vigilant stance and low, deep bark when on alert. However, he is affectionate, calm and well-behaved toward his human family.	The Perro de Presa Canario’s harsh, flat coat doesn’t require much grooming beyond regular weekly brushing and the occasional bath. He has strong, quickly growing nails that should be trimmed regularly, and his ears, which can be cropped, rose or naturally pendant, should be cleaned of any build-up of wax and debris. The Perro de Presa Canario’s energy level is relatively calm and stable, so he should be given regular exercise in a fenced yard or taken on several walks daily.	8	17	9	16
157	Peruvian Inca Orchid	3	3	2	4	4	3	3	5	2	1	5	2	Hound	Sighthound & Pariah (UKC), Miscellaneous (AKC)	Peru	750 A.D.	Pio, Perro Sin Pelo Del Peru, Perros Flora, Moonflower Dog, Inca Hairless Dog, Peruvian Hairless Dog	Agile and intelligent, the Peruvian Inca Orchid is an elegant sighthound that exudes the look of speed, strength and stamina. The breed can be one of three sizes — small, medium or large — and one of two varieties — hairless or coated, both of which can be born in the same litter. Regardless the variety, the breed can be many different skin and coat color and pattern combinations. Energetic and alert, the Peruvian Inca Orchid excels at hunting, lure coursing, rally and agility.	The Peruvian Inca Orchid is an ancient Spanish breed whose history is depicted in Moche, Chimu, Chancay and Incan pottery, as well as Chancay textiles. These hairless dogs were considered to bring about good luck, so their urine and feces were used in medicines, while their warmth was used to treat arthritis and respiratory conditions. The earliest version of the breed was primarily a small companion dog, however, these dogs were interbred with foreign dogs during the Conquistadors invasion of Peru, and developed three different sizes. American citizen Jack Walklin visited Peru in 1966 and returned to the United States with eight dogs, serving as the foundation stock for the breed’s development in the United States. Walklin is credited with naming the breed, which was declared a National Patrimony in 2001 in Peru. The Peruvian Inca Orchid was recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of the Sighthound & Pariah Dog Group in 1996 and is also recognized by the American Kennel Club as part of its Miscellaneous Class.	Noble and affectionate, the Peruvian Inca Orchid makes for a devoted family companion, not to mention a good watchdog due to his loyalty, independence and protective instincts. The Peruvian Inca Orchid isn’t recommended for families with small children, but does well with older children and smaller dogs and cats, provided he’s been raised with them from the start. This breed requires a substantial amount of training and socialization, so owners should be advised of a hefty time commitment.	Because of the breed’s lack of coat on the hairless variety, the Peruvian Inca Orchid should not be kept outside. Nonetheless, he requires sunscreen anytime he goes outdoors in sunny weather. Aside from regular grooming, such as nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing, the breed only needs the occasional bath. The lively, active Peruvian Inca Orchid should be given plenty of exercise, such as free play in a fenced yard or taken on several walks a day. The breed also enjoys games of hide-and-seek, chasing balls and learning a new trick or two.	25	35	13	15
158	Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen	4	3	4	5	4	2	4	1	1	2	4	4	Hound	Scenthound	France	1700s	Little Griffon Vendeen Basset	A correctly proportioned Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen is about 50 percent longer than tall, enabling the dog to push through dense thickets. This breed has strong bone and surprising nimbleness. The gait is free, giving the appearance of a dog that is capable of a full day in the field. The tousled appearance results in part from the rough coat, with long facial furnishings. This, in combination with the thick shorter undercoat, gives the PBGV ample protection against brambles and the elements. The dog’s alert and friendly expression reflects this breed’s true nature.	The PBGV, as it is affectionately known, is an ancient breed with roots in sixteenth-century Europe. The long French name provides an accurate description of the breed: Petit (small) Basset (low) Griffon (rough-coated) Vendéen (its area of origin in France). This area, on the west coast of France, is filled with thick brambles, underbrush, and rocky terrain, requiring a dog that had a coat that could withstand thorns and brambles, short legs that could enable the dog to wind his way through the underbrush in pursuit of rabbits, but nimbleness to run over rocks and logs without tiring. Thus, the PBGV is more than a wirecoated Basset Hound, and more than a dwarf Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen (a breed that resembles a slightly taller PBGV), even though closely related to both breeds. In England in the mid 1800s, the PBGV was shown with the Basset Hound as a wire-coated variety, but the PBGV is a longer legged, more nimble hound. In France, the Griffon Vendéen was considered to be one breed with two sizes until the 1950s. The AKC recognized the PBGV in 1990, and since then the PBGV has attracted many new admirers because of its merry disposition and tousled carefree appearance.	Despite its appearance, the PBGV is not a Basset Hound in a wire coat. It is a merry, inquisitive, tough, busy dog, always on the lookout for excitement and fun. This dog loves to sniff, explore, trail, and dig. Amiable and playful, the PBGV is good with children, other dogs, and most pets, and is friendly toward strangers. The breed is stubborn and independent, and tends to dig and bark.	Not content to lie around, this dog’s exercise requirements can be easily fulfilled, however, by a good walk on leash or a vigorous romp in the yard. The coat needs weekly brushing and occasional tidying of straggling hairs.	45	55	21	25
159	Pharaoh Hound	3	4	3	3	4	2	2	1	3	1	3	4	Hound	Sighthound	Malta	Ancient times	Kelb-tal Fenek	Although considered a sighthound in America, the Pharaoh Hound historically has hunted by both sight and scent—as well as hearing. The dog has an unexaggerated greyhound-like build, combining grace, power, and speed to run nimbly along rocky walls and ground. The breed has a good nose and large mobile ears that helped the dog follow animals underground. Slightly longer than tall, the gait is free and flowing, with the head held high. The coat is short and glossy.	The Pharaoh Hound is one of several breeds with a legitimate claim of most-ancient breed and appears to have changed little in the last 3,000 years. The breed bears an uncanny resemblance to the jackal god Anubis and to dogs depicted on the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs, and later, dogs featured in ancient Greek art. Phoenician traders may have introduced the dogs from Greece and North Africa to the islands of Malta and Gozo, where they became essentially secluded from the rest of the world. Here they flourished as rabbit dogs, or Kelb-tal Fenek. The Pharaoh Hound is now the National Dog of Malta. In the 1960s, the breed was rediscovered and imported to England and later America. The AKC recognized it in 1983.	The svelte Pharaoh Hound is a gracious addition to the home. However, although calm indoors, this breed loves to run. The dog is sensitive, loving, gentle, and good with children and other dogs, but it may chase strange animals given the breed’s hunting history. The dog tends to be reserved with strangers; some are even timid.  The breed is independent but willing to please, and has the unique characteristic of “blushing” when excited, with the nose and ears turning a rosy color.	The Pharaoh Hound relishes the opportunity to stretch and run in a safe area, although the dog can manage with long daily walks on leash and occasional sprints. The dog enjoys and needs soft bedding and warmth. The coat is low maintenance, requiring only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	40	60	20	25
160	Plott Hound	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	4	2	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1750	\N	The Plott is a no-frills dog originally bred to follow cold trails at speed over rough terrain and through water in all weather, and to grapple with large animals once cornered. The breed is streamlined and agile, yet powerful with great endurance. The hair is short to medium in length, fine to medium coarse in texture. The Plott is bold and confident, not backing down from a challenge. The dog’s voice is open and unrestricted, with a loud bugle-like chop or bawl.	Now the official state dog of North Carolina, the Plott’s roots spring from Germany, where Hanoverian Schweisshunds were valued for their ability to hunt wild boars and track game even over week-old trails. In 1750, 16-year-old Joahnnes Georg Plott brought five of these dogs with him to his new home in the Great Smoky Mountains. The Plott family bred their line of cold-trailing brindle dogs for seven generations, the dogs distributing across the Smoky Mountains as their family grew. Other mountain men incorporated the Plott blood into their own lines of dogs, but stories disagree as to the extent, if any, other strains were introduced to the Plotts. It was not until the early 1900s that documented crosses with other lines were made to improve the Plott strain. At that time Gola Ferguson crossed his Plotts with a strain of black-saddled hounds known as Blevins or Great Smokies, producing “Tige” and “Boss,” two hounds of such talent that even the Plott family incorporated their blood back into their line. This introduced the black-saddled brindle pattern into the breed. Almost all Plotts can be traced back to one of these dogs. In 1946 the breed finally received the official name of Plott Hound when it was recognized by the UKC. It is the only UKC coonhound breed that doesn’t trace back to foxhounds. In 1989 it was designated the official state dog of North Carolina. In 2006 the AKC admitted the Plott into the Hound Group.	The Plott’s first nature is to sniff up a cold trail and follow it to the end, yet the Plott makes the transition to family dog with ease, being eager to please and loyal. This is an extremely courageous breed, and, as befitting any good hound, can be headstrong. Plotts can be wary of strangers, but generally warm up quickly. They are not as gregarious with other dogs as some hounds, and can may be protective when pushed. They may trail and chase other animals, and so should have conscientious guardians.	Plotts are easy keepers, but must have a securely fenced yard. They need canine or human companionship and an opportunity to exercise outdoors in play or on well-supervised woodland hikes. They enjoy swimming. Coat care is minimal.	30	35	17	20
161	Polish Lowland Sheepdog	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	4	4	5	Herding	Livestock, Herding	Poland	Ancient times	Polski Owczarek Nizinny, PON	The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a cobby, medium-sized dog, slightly longer than tall, with great agility. The breed is strong and muscular, enabling the dog to control livestock. The gait is fluid with a long stride, allowing this dog to trot effortlessly for hours. The dog is inclined to amble, which can act as a reconnaissance energy-efficient gait. Toeing in is considered natural. The coat is long, dense, shaggy, and double, providing great protection against the elements.	The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is known in much of the world as the Polski Owczarek Nizinny (pronounced poleski off-chair-ick na-gin-nee), and even in America it goes by its nickname, the PON. The breed’s origins probably reach back to Central Asia from one or more Tibetan breeds, such as the Tibetan Terrier, which were probably introduced to Eastern Europe by Tibetan traders. The long-coated Tibetan dogs were probably interbred with corded-coated Hungarian sheepdogs introduced by the Huns in the fourth century. While large flock-guarding dogs staved off large predators, the smaller PONs worked with shepherds to move and control sheep, and also kept watch against intruders. Unlike larger dogs, they didn’t scare the sheep and they could work all day. They worked on the Polish lowlands for centuries until interest in purebred dogs and livestock swept through Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Several PONs left the plains to live and work on large estates. In 1924 PONs were shown at a Warsaw poultry and dog show. Most dogs had to be abandoned when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, but legend has it that a Warsaw PON named Psyche was valued for her ability to predict incoming bombs, alerting people to take cover in shelters. The first PONs were registered with the Polish Kennel Club in 1957. In 2001 the PON was admitted to the AKC under the English translation of its name, Polish Lowland Sheepdog.	Lively and loyal, the PON has been shaped by centuries of work as a shepherd. This is a territorial breed that is often wary of stranger, but is affectionate to family and friends. A PON’s bark is one of its best friends, and the typical PON shows that bark often. The PON has an independent and even willful side. The dog learns quickly, but sees no use in following commands blindly. Despite the shaggy dog look, the PON can be quite a serious dog. PONs are good with considerate children, most other pets, and most other dogs, although if challenged by a dog, they will hold their own.	The PON is not a cuddly overgrown lapdog, but a serious worker that needs a job to be satisfied. This dog needs to exercise the body and mind daily, flourishing when allowed to herd or learn agility. The PON does not accept extended confinement, but does best living inside and working and playing outside. The coat needs considerable care, preferably brushing every couple of days.	3	7	8	11
162	Pomeranian	4	1	4	1	1	3	1	1	1	3	3	5	Toy	Spitz	Germany	1800s	\N	The Pomeranian is a small, square-proportioned, miniature spitz with a cobby, rounded body. This breed shares the spitz characteristics of small ears, double coat, and curled tail. The expression is alert and fox-like, and the gait is smooth and free with good reach and drive. The soft thick undercoat combined with the longer harsh outer coat, standing off from the body, combine to give the dog a unique puffy appearance. This look is further accentuated by the thick ruff and a head carriage that is naturally upgazing.	The smallest member of the spitz family, the Pomeranian boasts tough sledding dog ancestors. Exactly when the dog began to be bred down in size is not known; nor is it known exactly where this miniaturization took place, although Germany, and specifically, Pomerania, is the most likely locale. The breed’s likely ancestor was the Deutscher Spitz. Only when the breed was taken to England was it dubbed the Pomeranian, but these early dogs were not the “Poms” known today. They weighed as much as 30 pounds and were often white. In fact, the Japanese Spitz closely resembles these early Pomeranians and very likely descends from them. Although the Pomeranian was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1870, it was not until Queen Victoria brought a Pomeranian from Italy that popularity grew. The queen’s Pomeranians were rather large gray dogs. By 1900, Poms had been recognized by the AKC, and dogs were being shown in both England and America in an array of colors. This miniature sled dog always attracts admirers and is a very popular pet and show dog.	Bouncy, bold, and busy, the Pomeranian makes the most of every day. This breed is curious, playful, self-confident (even cocky), and attentive, ever ready for a game or adventure. Reserved toward strangers, some can be territorial toward other dogs, and some enjoy a good barking session.	The Pomeranian is active but diminutive, needing daily exercise but able to meet activity needs with indoor games or short walks. The double coat needs brushing twice weekly, more when shedding.	45	65	21	21
163	Poodle	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	5	5	3	5	Non-sporting	Water Dog	Germany, Central Europe	1500s	Barbone, Caniche	The Poodle is a square-proportioned dog with a proud carriage and elegant appearance. The dog should move with a light, springy, effortless stride. The Poodle stems from working retriever stock, and the conformation should reflect this athletic background. The coat is curly, harsh, and dense, forming a water resistant barrier. If corded, it should hang in tight even cords. The traditional show clips stem from functional and decorative tradition. The Poodle is active, intelligent, and elegant. This breed has a proud bearing and air of distinction.	Although the Poodle is most often identified with France, its earliest ancestors were probably curly-coated dogs from central Asia that assisted with herding and followed many routes into various parts of Europe. Interwoven in their ancestry are also several rough-coated water dogs. Perhaps the earliest incarnation of the Poodle was the Barbet, a curly-coated dog distributed in France, Russia, Hungary, and elsewhere. It is the German version, however, that exerted most influence on the modern Poodle. In fact, the word poodle comes from the German word pfudel, meaning puddle or “to splash,” probably reflecting the dog’s water abilities. In France, it was known as caniche or chien canard, both referring to duck-hunting abilities. The Poodle was also drawn into service as a military dog, guide dog, guard dog, wagon puller for performers, and eventually, a circus performer. The coat was shorn close to facilitate swimming, but left slightly longer on the chest for warmth in cold water. Although some believe the puffs of hair around the leg joints and tail tip were for protection when hunting, other evidence suggests that they arose as decoration during the Poodle’s performing days. The Poodle became favored by French aristocracy and eventually became the national dog of France. The characteristic clip was accentuated. In the 1900’s, Poodle popularity in America waned. By the late 1920s, Poodles had almost died out in North America. In the 1930s, the breed staged a comeback that eventually placed the Poodle as the most popular dog in America for decades.	Among the very smartest and most obedient of dogs, the Standard Poodle combines playful exuberance with a zest for life’s adventures. This breed retains its hunting heritage, and loves to run, swim, and retrieve. The dog gets along well with everyone, although is somewhat reserved with strangers. The Poodle is excellent with children.	All Poodles need a lot of interaction with people. They also need mental and physical exercise. A brief but challenging obedience or play session, combined with a walk, should be part of every Poodle’s day. Standard Poodles will need more exercise and may especially enjoy swimming. They should preferably be brushed every other day or weekly for shorter coats. Poodle hair, when shed, does not fall out but becomes caught in the surrounding hair, which can cause matting if not removed. The pet clips are easier to maintain and can be done every four to six weeks.	9	13	8	12
164	Portuguese Podengo	4	3	4	3	5	4	4	2	2	2	2	5	Hound	Primitive	Portugal	Ancient times	Portuguese Warren Hound	The Portuguese Podengo is a breed of moderation, a rustic dog that always look natural. Historically, when hunting they went by scent first, hearing second, and sight third. Their coat may be smooth, which is short and very dense; or wire, which is long and harsh but not as dense as the smooth coat. Neither has an undercoat. The Pequeno is 20 percent longer than tall. Their movement is light and agile.	The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno (pronounced peh-KEN-oo) is the smallest of three Portuguese Podengo breeds, the other two being the Medio and Grande. Their ancestors were brought by the ancient Romans and Phoenicians to the Iberian Peninsula over 2,000 years ago. Different sized dogs gradually became specialized to hunt different sized prey, with the smallest dogs hunting small game for their peasant owners.Although the original dogs had smooth coats, ideal in Portugal’s wet north, wiry coats flourished in hot, dry southern Portugal where brambles were particularly abundant. “Podengo” has been used at least since the 16th century to mean any pack hunting dog. The dogs hunted together using first their sense of scent, then hearing, to locate and flush small animals from crevices and dense undergrowth. They are said to use their hearing to hone in by calling to each other with a single yip (called the Maticar).Podengos were also adept at protecting from rodents and they accompanied Portuguese ships — possibly spreading them to other ports. The Podengo is one of the 10 National Dogs of Portugal.  They are considered an integral part of the Portuguese people’s survival through the centuries and are still widely popular there today. The first smooth Pequeno came to the United States in 1995, and the first wire in 2001.	Pequenos are active, independent dogs that love to explore. While they are affectionate they are not lap dogs, preferring adventure to cuddling. As with most primitive breeds, they aren’t great obedience dogs, but they do aim to please. They are often friendly toward strangers, other dogs, and usually, other pets. They are often alert dogs who detect strangers or visitors and bark in response.	Podengos are active, little dogs and need a good walk or jog daily, plus a chance to run and explore weekly. Given adequate exercise they are often well-mannered members of the household, but relaxation is not their favorite thing. They tend to enjoy activities like agility. The Podengo generally has a rustic look, so trimming isn’t needed. Even the wire coat needs only weekly brushing. Long hairs around the eyes, particularly in the corners, should be gently plucked.	35	60	17	23
165	Portuguese Water Dog	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	5	3	4	Working	Water dog	Portugal	Middle Ages	Cao de Agua	The Portuguese Water Dog is a robust dog of medium build, slightly longer than they are tall. They are often strong and well muscled. They have a profuse single coat, either wavy or curly. Two styles of grooming clips may be seen on this breed: the lion clip, in which the muzzle and middle part, up to the tail tip, are clipped, and the retriever clip, in which the entire coat is scissored to about 1 inch in length, with tail tip again left full length. The Portuguese Water Dog’s expression is often steady, penetrating, and attentive, reflecting their spirited disposition.	The consummate water dog, the Portuguese Water Dog probably shares some of their ancestry with the Poodle. Their ancestors were herding dogs from the central Asian steppes, either brought to Portugal by way of the Visigoths in the fifth century or by way of the Berbers and then Moors in the eighth century. Once in Portugal, they distinguished themselves through their affinity for water, eventually herding fish into nets, retrieving lost nets or equipment, and serving as a boat-to-boat or boat-to-shore courier.Later the dogs were part of trawler crews fishing the waters from Portugal to Iceland. The breed is known in its native land as Cao de Agua (pronounced Kown-d’Ahgwa), which means dog of water. They come in a long-haired variety known as the Cao de Agua de Pelo Ondulado and a curly-coated variety known as the Cao de Agua de Pelo Encaradolado. With the demise of traditional fishing methods, the Portuguese fishermen and their dogs began to disappear from the coast in the early twentieth century. The breed was saved largely through the attempts of one man, Dr. Vasco Bensuade, a wealthy shipping magnate. He promoted the breed, and through his efforts, the breed club was reorganized.  After a brief appearance in England in the 1950s, the breed virtually died out there. Around this time, the first PWDs came to America, where they slowly gained a following. Their popularity grew more rapidly and the breed is now a loving family companion.	The gregarious Portuguese Water Dog is a fun-loving, family-loving, water-loving dog. They are often good with children, other dogs, and pets. They can be sensitive and respond well to direction. They are usually a good breed for an active person wanting an adventurous, affectionate, biddable partner.	This is an active breed needing daily physical and mental exercise, preferably involving swimming and retrieving. Otherwise, they need a long walk or jog or a vigorous play time. Their coat needs brushing every other day, plus monthly professional grooming.	14	18	10	11
166	Pug	3	2	4	4	3	3	2	1	3	2	5	5	Toy	Mastiff	China	Ancient times	Mops, Carlin	Square-proportioned, compact and of a stocky build, the Pug is a large dog in a little space. Their gait is strong and jaunty, but with a slight roll of the hindquarters. Their distinctive expression is soft and solicitous. Their forehead has large, deep wrinkles. Their coat is fine, smooth, and short.	The Pug has been known by many names: Mopshond in Holland (which refers to its grumbling tendencies); Mops in Germany, and Dutch or Chinese Pug in England. The word Pug is derived either from the Latin pugnus meaning fist, as the head may have resembled a clenched fist, or from the marmoset “Pug” monkeys that the Pug dogs somewhat resemble.Whatever the name, one thing is true: the Pug’s official motto “Multum in Parvo” (a lot in a little) fits them exactly. The Pug is somewhat of an exception in the Toy Group because they are perhaps the only one to be descended from mastiff forebears. Although their exact ancestry has been lost in antiquity, the Pug retains many mastiff characteristics.The Pug is an ancient breed, one of several miniaturized in the Orient, where they were a favorite pet of Buddhist monasteries in Tibet many centuries ago. In China, the facial wrinkles were an essential breed feature, most notably the “prince mark,” or vertical wrinkle on their forehead, which bore a resemblance to the Chinese character for “prince.”Pugs probably came to Holland by way of the Dutch East India Trading Company. Here they became quite popular and were recognized as the official dog of the House of Orange after one saved the life of Prince William by sounding an alarm at the approach of Spanish soldiers in 1572.By 1790, the Pug could be found in France; Napoleon’s wife Josephine used her Pug to carry messages to Napoleon when she was imprisoned. Pugs were first brought to England during Victorian times and became incredibly popular with the wealthy, displacing the King Charles Spaniel as the favored royal breed. Several Pugs were brought to England from China in 1886. A year earlier, the breed had been recognized by the AKC. Since that time, they have remained popular a pet.	A delightful blend of dignity and comedy, the Pug is an amiable, playful, and confident companion. They can be stubborn and headstrong, but they are pleasant and generally willing to please. They love to cavort and show off.	The Pug needs daily exercise, either in the form of a lively game or a moderate walk. They do not do well in heat and humidity. They needs minimal coat care but daily cleaning of facial wrinkles. Their smooth coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hairs; however, the wrinkles need regular cleaning and drying to prevent skin infections. The Pug may often wheeze and snore.	25	35	16	17
167	Puli	4	3	3	2	1	3	1	5	2	5	4	5	Herding	Herding	Hungary	Middle Ages	Hungarian Puli, Hungarian Water Dog	The Puli is a compact dog of square proportion and medium build. Their gait at a trot is quick stepping, but not far reaching. The Puli is able to change directions instantly, and is often quick, agile, and even acrobatic. Their weatherproof coat consists of a soft, wooly, dense undercoat and a wavy or curly outer coat. This coat will form round or flattened cords, but it may also be brushed out.	Around the ninth century the Magyar tribes came from the eastern Urals to occupy the central Danube area, intermingling with Turkish people along the way. They brought with them various sheepdogs, including the forebear of the modern Puli.The Puli’s resemblance in body structure to the Tibetan Spaniel has led some to surmise that the latter may have played a role in the Puli’s development. Whatever the origin, the small dogs were agile sheepherders.  Their black color was important so that they could be easily spotted by the shepherd among the sheep. Thus, the Magyar’s larger dogs were probably used as nighttime guards, and the small black dogs as daytime herders.After the decimation of Hungary by invaders in the sixteenth century, the country was repopulated by people, sheep, and dogs from western Europe. These dogs interbred with the native Pulik to produce the Pumi, and then the Puli and Pumi were interbred to such an extent that the original Puli breed was nearly lost. In the early 1900s, an effort began to resurrect the Puli. Around that time, Pulik in Hungary varied greatly in height from large “police” through medium “working” to small “dwarf” sizes. The medium-sized dogs were most representative of the traditional herding Puli and were established as the desired size.In 1935, the Puli were introduced to America and by 1936 the AKC recognized the breed. The breed’s fame spread farther throughout Europe as a result of Hungarians fleeing the war, bringing with them their dogs. The modern Puli enjoys modest popularity as a family pet.	A mop on springs, the Puli is full of bouncing energy. They are busy and curious and need daily exercise. This smart dog is also headstrong and assertive. They may need to be carefully introduced to other dogs. Alert and watchful, they tend to bark a lot.	This is an energetic breed on the lookout for a job, preferably something to herd. They can be satisfied with a good walk or jog, or a lively game and training session, however. Their coat can hold debris. Their nonshedding coat can be brushed or corded; if brushed, it needs brushing every one to two days. If corded, the cords must be regularly separated because the coat tends to hold dirt; bathing is time consuming and drying takes as much as one day. This dog can be professionally groomed or clipped.	27	29	15	19
168	Pumi	4	4	5	5	3	3	2	4	5	4	2	4	Herding	Herding	Hungary	800 A.D.	\N	Recognized for his corkscrew-curled coat, expressive semi-erect ears and quirky expression, the Pumi is undeniably cute with an affinity for both work and play. This Hungarian herding breed is medium-sized, compact and agile, always on alert and ready for action. Versatile and adaptable, the Pumi is used to herd cattle, sheep and swine, and is equally skilled at gathering, driving and keeping livestock within its boundaries as directed by the shepherd.	The Pumi was developed over centuries by Hungarian shepherds to drive livestock from the village to pastures on the outskirts of town, keeping them away from nearby gardens and fields. During the day, the Pumi tended the livestock under the direction of the shepherd, and then drove them back into the village in the evening. The Pumi is one of three Hungarian herding breeds to have originated from Tibetan herding-guarding dogs that migrated with the Hungarians and their livestock to the Carpathian Basin of central Europe around 800 A.D. In the early 20th century, the Hungarians separated the Pumi, Puli and Mudi into separate breeds. The Pumi was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1996 and by the American Kennel Club in 2016.	Bold, spirited and lively, the Pumi does best in an active household in which plenty of activity and attention can be given. He’s eager to please and bonds closely with his human family. This intelligent, mindful breed deeply assesses each new situation in which he’s placed and can be reserved, especially among strangers.	The Pumi’s coat — half soft hair, half harsher hair — doesn’t shed much, but requires combing every three to six weeks, as well as a quick rinse to allow the coat to curl back up. Once it does, the coat may be trimmed. Because of the Pumi’s high energy and keen intelligence, he requires regular exercise to keep him physically and mentally stimulated. He enjoys games of retrieving tennis balls or flying discs, and also excels in agility, obedience and other dog sports. Keep in mind the Pumi is agile, courageous and insatiably curious, meaning he’s not afraid to climb over or under anything to get a good vantage point of what’s going on at any given moment. Early socialization and proper training are a must.	15	30	15	21
169	Pyrenean Shepherd	5	4	5	5	2	2	2	3	4	4	3	5	Herding	Herding	France	Ancient times	\N	A small, sinewy, light-boned dog, the Pyrenean Shepherd is a superb athlete, incredibly agile and ready for action. The Rough-Faced Pyrenean Shepherd is clearly longer than tall; the Smooth-Face Pyrenean Shepherd appears more square. The Rough-Faced dog’s coat can be of almost flat demi-long or long hair. Demi-long dogs have culottes on their rump. Longhaired dogs have wooly hair that may cord, especially on the elbows and thighs. The hair on their muzzle lengthens toward the cheeks, giving a windblown look. The Smooth-Faced dog’s muzzle has short hair on the muzzle and legs, with the body hair 2 to 3 inches long on the body, and some feathering on the legs. The Pyrenean Shepherd’s flowing gait is said to “shave the earth.”	Sheep and goat herding were well established in the Pyrenees Mountains of southern France by 6000 b.c., and bones of small dogs were found in the region long before then. By Medieval times, shepherds and their dogs are mentioned in accounts of Pyrenean life. The quick and agile small dogs controlled the flocks while the larger ones, Great Pyrenees, guarded them.In 1858, a Pyrenean Shepherd was with the shepherdess Bernadette Soubirous at Lourdes when she claimed the Virgin Mary appeared to her, giving the breed the designation as “the dog who saw God.” During World War I, many hundreds of Pyrenean Shepherds served as couriers and as search and rescue dogs. The officer in charge of war dogs proclaimed them “the most intelligent, the most cunning, the most able, and the fastest” of the breeds. In 1905, an association was formed to preserve the Pyrenean Shepherd and Great Pyrenees. Some Pyrenean Shepherd came to America in the 1800s with their flocks and shepherds, and in the 1930s some came with the founder of the Great Pyrenees in America. The AKC recognized them in 2009. The breed has always come in two coat types, Rough-Faced and Smooth-Faced, which have different body types as well.	Pyrenean Shepherds are often strongly oriented toward working and herding. They tend to be extremely active, attentive, and obedient, and are among the very top breeds for agility, obedience, and herding.  They can be distrustful of strangers, but are strongly devoted to and affectionate with their family. Some can be very shy. Some get along well with other dogs and pets, but some may have jealousy issues. They can bark exuberantly, and are good watchdogs inside of the home, detecting strangers or visitors and barking in response.	The Pyrenean Shepherd are among the most active, driven, and responsive of all breeds. They must have an outlet for their busy mind and body every day. They should have a vigorous run or long jog several times a week and some sort of mental challenges daily. Without this, they can be frustrated and destructive; with it, they can be some of the most impressively smart and well-behaved dogs around. Both coat types require less care than they would seem. Weekly brushing should suffice.	8	25	10	18
170	Rat Terrier	4	3	5	4	3	3	2	2	4	1	2	5	Terrier	Terrier	United States	1800s	\N	The Rat Terrier is historically known for protecting homes or farms from rodents. They are sturdy and compact little dog but also elegant. There are two sizes of Rat Terriers, but both are slightly longer than tall (but not short-legged) with a moderate build. Their coat is short and smooth. The American Hairless Terrier is derived from Rat Terriers with a hairless mutation.	The Rat Terrier’s ancestors probably included Manchester Terriers, Smooth Fox Terriers, Old English White Terriers, and Bull Terriers, among others. Working class British immigrants brought mixes of these breeds to America in the late 1800s. Rat Terriers were used for protecting homes and farms from rodents.Rat Terriers were popular farm dogs by the early 1900s–they were probably among the most popular dogs in America. President Theodore Roosevelt even kept them in the White House. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a short-legged offshoot of the Rat Terrier. In the early 1900s, Midwestern farmers mixed Rat Terriers with Whippets and Italian Greyhounds to increase speed so they could better protect the farm’s crops. In the South, they were mixed with Beagles for better scenting ability. This was done in part because the Rat Terrier was traditionally considered a strain, rather than a breed. As a result, the Rat Terrier’s size varies.	The Rat Terrier is often a loyal and energetic companion, very playful, and always on a quest for fun and adventure. They’re usually eager to please and learn quickly but do have a stubborn streak and can become easily bored and distracted. They are somewhat reserved with strangers. The hound in their background can sometimes make them friendlier toward other dogs compared to most terriers, and most get along well—but they often won’t back down from a challenge. They can be good with cats if properly socialized with them, but introductions to small pets are ill-advised. Most Rat Terriers are not excessive barkers.	Rat Terriers tend to be a very active and playful dog. A daily walk around the block, coupled with several play sessions will help meet their exercise needs. Indoor games and tricks can provide mental exercise on inclement days. With exercise, they are a calm member of the household. Their thin coat and small size makes them vulnerable to chilling. Coat care is minimal.	45	65	21	27
171	Redbone Coonhound	3	3	3	4	4	2	3	2	2	1	3	3	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1800s	Redbone Hound	The Redbone Coonhound is both fast and agile, often able to traverse or hike through rocky hills, and even swim through water at a fast pace. They can follow a cold trail and have a sweet voice. Their coat is short and smooth but coarse enough to provide protection.	Like most coonhounds, the Redbone derives from foxhound ancestors. Scottish immigrants brought red foxhounds to America in the late 1700s, and they may have formed the basis of the breed.The breed’s development was heavily influenced by George Birdsong, who began with a pack he obtained in the 1840s. As more people became interested in the breed, they set about to create a faster, hotter-nosed dog that was even quicker to locate scents. They mixed the existing dogs with later imports of hot, swift Red Irish Foxhounds. These early dogs were sometimes called Saddlebacks because they tended to be red with black saddles. However color was emphasized for several generations, resulting in the solid-colored red dogs. The breed became known as Redbone Coonhounds, either in recognition of its color or after Peter Redbone, a Tennessee promoter of the breed.In 1902 the Redbone Coonhound became the second coonhound breed recognized by the UKC. Over 100 years later, in 2010, it became a regular AKC breed. The Redbone remains a favorite family pet to this day.	Redbone Coonhounds are generally easygoing, gentle dogs that don’t let much bother them. They want to be with their people, but aren’t clingy or “in your face.” Redbone Coonhounds are often eager to please but can become bored with formal training. They are active when on the hike, but quiet inside. Their passion is to follow their nose, and once their nose hits a scent they might be oblivious to much else. Redbone Coonhounds often get along well with people, children, and dogs, but may or may not do well with small pets.	Because they are driven to follow their nose as fast as they can, care must be taken to exercise Redbone Coonhounds in safe, fenced areas. They do well with a daily walk or jog, and enjoy swimming. Redbone Coonhounds are very family oriented and make good members of the household. Some tend to drool. They have a loud, melodious voice when trailing or exited. Coat care consists of weekly brushing.	70	85	24	27
172	Rhodesian Ridgeback	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	4	3	1	3	4	Hound	Sighthound, Scenthound	South Africa	1800s	African Lion Hound	Slightly longer than tall, the Rhodesian Ridgeback combines features of speed, power, and endurance. The Rhodesian Ridgeback has an athletic build. Their stride is efficient and long. Their short glossy coat is adapted for living in hot climates. A distinctive feature is the clearly defined ridge, which starts with two identical whorls just behind their shoulders and taper to the prominence of their hipbones.	When European settlers arrived in South Africa in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they brought with them such breeds as the Mastiff, Great Dane, Bloodhound, Pointer, Staghound, and Greyhound, among others. These settlers needed a dog that could be comfortable in both hot and cold temperatures, limited water, and rough bush, while performing the duties of a hunting dog. By mixing their European dogs with native Hottentot tribal hunting dogs (which were distinguished by a ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction along the top of their back) they produced just such a dog. These dogs hunted by both sight and scent and were devoted protectors of the entire family.In the 1870s, several of these dogs were taken to Rhodesia to protect from lions, tracking them and then keeping them at bay. The “lion dogs” were so successful that they soon became popular, their distinctive ridge becoming a trademark. By the 1920s, so many different types of ridged Lion Dogs existed in Rhodesia that a meeting was held to elucidate the most desirable points of the breed, which became the basis for the current breed. Dogs meeting the standard criteria were known as Rhodesian Ridgebacks.Rhodesian Ridgebacks were introduced into England in the 1930s and to America soon after. In both cases, they gained recognition in the 1950s and quickly attracted admirers. In the 1980s, the breed received recognition as a sighthound and became eligible to compete in sighthound field trials. Today, Rhodesian Ridgebacks are among the more popular hounds, undoubtedly because they are an athletic companion in a sleek handsome body.	The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a somewhat assertive dog. They are generally good with children, and can be protective of those in their family, but can be sometimes overly boisterous in play for small children. They are strong-willed and powerful; some can become domineering. They tend to be reserved with strangers. They often do well around other dogs, although two males should be supervised. Ridgebacks are good with cats if they are properly socialized or introduced to them.	The Rhodesian Ridgeback loves to run, and they need daily mental and physical exercise to keep from becoming bored. They can be a good jogging or hiking companion. Coat care is minimal, consisting only of occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	80	135	22	27
173	Rottweiler	3	3	2	2	1	2	1	5	3	1	4	5	Working	Mastiff	Germany	Ancient times	\N	The Rottweiler is a medium large breed, slightly longer than they are tall, and robust with a powerful, substantial build. Historically, they combine the abilities that were necessary for jobs that entail great strength, agility, and endurance. Their trot is sure and powerful, with strong reach and drive. Their coat is straight, coarse, and dense. Their muzzle is short enough for strength but long enough for proper breathing and cooling. Their expression reflects some of their best traits; noble, alert, and self-assured.	The Rottweiler’s ancestors were probably Roman drover dogs, responsible for driving and guarding herds of cattle as they accompanied Roman troops on long marches. At least one of these marches led to southern Germany, where some of the people and their dogs settled.Throughout the succeeding centuries, the dogs continued to play a vital role as cattle drovers as well as provided protection from bears around what was to become the town of Rottweil (which is derived from red tile, denoting the red tile roof of the Roman baths that had been unearthed there in the eighth century). These dogs almost certainly mixed with various Sennehund (Mountain Dog) strains. Rottweil prospered and became a center of cattle commerce. Their dogs drove and guarded cattle and guarded the money earned by the cattle sales. With the advent of trains, cattle driving was outlawed, so the Rottweiler found a new job. So evolved the Rottweiler metzgerhund (butcher dog), an integral component in the town’s industry until the mid nineteenth century.The Rottweiler was also used as a draft dog, but it was replaced by donkeys. With little need for this once vital breed, the Rottweiler fell into such decline that they were nearly lost. In 1905 there was only one female Rottweiler in Rottweil. With the realization that the breed was teetering near extinction, a club was formed in 1901 and set about to revive it. Even though the 1901 club was short-lived, it did formulate a breed standard. Two subsequent clubs were formed in 1907, one of which promoted the breed as a police dog. The two clubs merged in 1921. The breed continued to grow, and by 1931 had arrived in America and gained AKC recognition.Rottweilers have since been used as a police, military, and even mountain rescue dog. The Rottweiler recovered from its brush with extinction to work their way to the second most popular breed in America by the early 1990s. Their popularity has since slightly decreased and they have found themselves in homes better suited to their needs.	Confident, bold and alert, the Rottweiler can be a popular choice for households. As befitting their self-assured nature, Rottweilers can tend to be headstrong and stubborn.  They can be reserved or guarded, toward strangers. They may be overly assertive if they perceive that their family is being threatened. They are a powerful breed that needs socialization, consistent training, and daily exercise.	The Rottweiler needs daily physical and mental activity, either in the form of long walks or jogs, or a vigorous game in a safe area, as well as training lessons. They typically enjoy cool weather and may become overheated in hot weather. Their coat care is minimal, consisting only of occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	120	200	26	28
174	Saint Bernard	2	2	3	4	2	4	3	1	3	3	5	2	Working	Mastiff	Switzerland	Middle Ages	St. Bernhardshund, Alpine Mastiff, St. Bernard	The Saint Bernard is powerful and proportionately tall. They are strong and well-muscled, necessary qualities that, in the past, helped them to travel through deep snow. Their coat comes in two types: smooth, in which the short hair is very dense and tough, and long, in which the medium length hair is straight to slightly wavy. Their expression is often thought to appear intelligent.	The Saint Bernard probably has their roots in the Roman Molossian dogs, but it wasn’t until between 1660 and 1670 that the breed developed into the magnificent dog responsible for saving so many lives.Around this time, the first of these large dogs arrived at the St. Bernard Hospice, a refuge for travelers crossing between Switzerland and Italy. The Saint Bernards originally came to help pull carts and turn spits and may have also functioned as watchdogs or companions, but the monks soon found them invaluable pathfinders through the deep snow.The dogs were adept at locating lost travelers. When a dog found a person, they would lick the person’s face and lie beside him, thus reviving and warming the person. These dogs continued to serve in this invaluable role for three centuries, saving over 2,000 lives.The most famous of all Saint Bernards was Barry, who was credited with saving 40 lives. Before Barry’s death, the dogs were known by several names, including Hospice Dogs, but by the time he died he was of such fame that the dogs were called Barryhund in his honor. In the early 1800s the breed was nearly lost. Some of the remaining dogs were crossed with Newfoundlands in 1830. As a result, the first long-coated dogs of Saint Bernard type appeared. Although it seemed that long hair would help these dogs in the cold snow, in fact it hindered them as the ice clung to their coat. Thus, these long-haired dogs did not participate in rescue work.The first Saints came to England around 1810, referred to by many different names, among them Sacred Dog. By 1865, the name Saint Bernard was in common use, and it became their official name in 1880. Around this time, the breed caught the eye of Americans. By 1900, the Saint Bernard was the most popular AKC breed. Although they has since vacillated in popularity, they are always one of the most popular of the giant breeds.	The calm, easygoing, low-energy Saint Bernard is gentle and patient around children, although they are not particularly playful. Most get along with other family dogs. They are not big barkers, but their bark is loud. They are devoted to their family and are willing to please, although at their own pace. They can sometimes be stubborn.	A Saint Bernard needs daily exercise in order to stay fit. Their requirements can be met with moderate walks and short runs, however. They typically enjoy cooler weather and do not do well in heat. Their coat, whether long or short, needs weekly brushing, more so when shedding. All Saint Bernards drool.	35	65	23	28
175	Saluki	2	3	3	3	3	3	1	2	3	2	3	3	Hound	Sighthound	Middle East	Ancient times	Gazelle Hound, Persian Greyhound	The Saluki has a general greyhound-like build and often combines the aspects of grace, great speed, and endurance coupled with strength.. Their expression often appears dignified and gentle with deep, faithful, far-seeing eyes. Their movement is light. Their coat is smooth and silky; the feathered variety has long hair on their ears, tail, between their toes, and sometimes on the backs of their legs; the smooth variety has no long feathering. This breed has a wide range of types, reflecting the wide area over which they developed.	The Saluki is one of the most ancient breeds of domestic dog. Evidence of the Saluki can be found on Egyptian tombs dating several thousand years b.c. The name Saluki may come from the ancient civilization of Seleucia. Arab nomads used Salukis to track gazelles, foxes, and hares in the desert, often with the aid of falcons. Although the Muslim religion considered the dog to be unclean, an exception was made for the Saluki, who was referred to as el hor, meaning ‘the noble one’.The Saluki was allowed to sleep in the tents and enjoy the tender attention of their Bedouin family. Salukis were not allowed to breed with non-Salukis, accounting for their consistency throughout the centuries. Because they ranged with their nomadic families over a wide area of the Middle East, Salukis became widely distributed with great local variation, resulting in the breed’s variability today.The Saluki came to the attention of the Western world around 1900 and was recognized by the AKC in 1928. Their numbers have decreased in the lands of their origin as the result of a variety of factors. The Arabian Saluki Center in Dubai is working to protect the Saluki in its native lands. The role of the Saluki today is as an companion animal.	The Saluki tends to be aloof and reserved with strangers. They are often extremely devoted to their own family, but are not particularly out-going. They are often very gentle with children, but may not be playful enough to satisfy most children. The Saluki can be extremely sensitive and does not take to rough and tumble play.  They can also be shy. They tend to be very quiet and sedate inside, seeking out a soft warm spot. Outside, they are capable of running in great circles at tremendous speeds and may try to chase small animals or fast-moving objects. They may not come when called.	Daily exercise is essential, if possible in the form of free-running in a safe and enclosed area. Their needs can also be met with long leash walks or jogging. The Saluki often loves a soft bed. A Saluki in proper weight is naturally thin, but many tend to be picky eaters, which can result in a very thin-looking dog. Their smooth coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hair, but the longer feathering needs combing once or twice a week to prevent matting. Feathered Salukis often grow a long coat over their entire body.	35	65	19	24
176	Samoyed	3	3	4	4	3	5	4	1	2	3	5	5	Working	Northern	Russia (Siberia)	Ancient times	Samoyedskaya	The Samoyed combines strength, agility, dignity, and grace in a general spitz outline. Slightly longer than they are tall, they are nonetheless compact. They have a strong, muscular body that is able to combine power, speed, agility, and endurance. They have a quick, agile stride with good reach and drive. Their double coat is heavy and weather resistant. Their undercoat is soft and thick, whereas the outer coat is straight and harsh, standing straight out from their body, and glistening with a silver sheen. Their expression is often animated, with the characteristic “Samoyed smile” created by the upcurved corners of their mouth.	The nomadic Samoyed people, for whom the Samoyed dog is named, came to northwestern Siberia from central Asia. They depended upon herds of reindeer for food, and had to keep on the move in order that the reindeer could find sufficient food for themselves. They also depended upon strong hardy spitz dogs to herd the reindeer and to guard them against the fierce predators of the Arctic. They occasionally helped to hunt and tow boats and sledges. These dogs lived as part of the family in the hide tents of their families, where one of their “jobs” was to keep the children warm in bed.The first Samoyeds came to England in the late 1800s, but not all these early imports were the pure white the breed is known for today. One of these dogs was presented to Queen Alexandria, who did much to promote the breed. Descendants of the queen’s dogs can still be found in modern pedigrees.In 1906, the first Samoyed came to America, originally a gift of Russia’s Grand Duke Nicholas. In the early 1900s, Samoyeds formed part of the sled teams on the expeditions to Antarctica and shared in the triumph of reaching the South Pole. The breed’s exploits, combined with their glistening good looks, soon won the public’s attention in America, and their popularity has grown tremendously since the Second World War. Although the once nomadic Samoyed people have long since settled in one place, the breed they created has journeyed around the world.	Gentle and playful, the Samoyed often makes a good companion for a child or person of any age. They are a closely bonded family dog. They are generally amiable with strangers, other pets, and usually, other dogs. They can be calm indoors, but this clever, sometimes mischievous breed needs daily physical and mental exercise. If allowed to become bored, they will dig and bark. They are independent and often stubborn, but they are willing to please and responsive to their family.  They may tend to herd children.	The Samoyed is active and needs a good workout every day, either in the form of a long walk or jog or a vigorous play session. They often like to pull and herd, and they prefer cooler weather. Their thick coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week, daily when shedding.	77	99	24	26
177	Sarplaninac	3	4	2	1	1	1	1	5	2	3	1	2	Shepherd	Guardian (UKC)	Yugoslavia	Unknown	Illyrian Shepherd Dog, Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog Sharplanina	\N	The Sarplaninac is an ancient guardian breed hailing from the mountainous terrain of Yugoslavia, or Illyria as it was known in the Roman age. As such, the breed formerly was called the Illyrian Shepherd Dog when it was recognized by the FCI in 1939 but was changed to the Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog Sharplanina, named after the Sharplanina Mountains where the breed was most commonly found, and finally, shortened to simply the Sarplaninac. The breed could not be exported from his homeland Yugoslavia until 1970 and even then had to be carried down from the mountains by mules before being exported to the United States. Today, the Sarplaninac remains a revered protector of flock and is gaining popularity among ranchers in the United States and Canada as a guardian of livestock. The United Kennel Club has recognized the Sarplaninac as a member of its Guardian Dog Group since 1995.	Calm, intelligent and independent, the Sarplaninac has a temperament similar to other guarding breeds. The breed is suspicious of strangers and courageous, quick to act to any threat toward his property or human family.	The Sarplaninac is a relatively healthy and hardy breed. His thick double coat sheds moderately heavy, so regular brushing and occasional bathing are a must, as is regular nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing. Because the Sarplaninac is accustomed to having plenty of room to roam on a farm or in rural areas, the breed requires lots of outdoor exercise, preferably in a large fenced yard. Plenty of daily physical exercise and mental stimulation will keep this independent breed from becoming destructive, as will proper training and socialization during puppyhood. Stubborn and endlessly devoted to his work, the Sarplaninac is not recommend for first-time dog owners.	10	16	10	13
178	Schipperke	4	3	3	4	3	3	2	4	3	2	4	5	Non-sporting	Spitz	Belgium	1600s	\N	The Schipperke is a small, sturdy dog, square-proportioned, appearing to slope from shoulders to hindquarters. This appearance is helped by their double coat. Their fox-like face can appear questioning and mischievous, even impudent. Their trot is smooth and graceful. This is an agile and active dog.	The origin of the Schipperke is controversial. One plausible theory is that they originated as a dog of the boatmen who traveled between Brussels and Antwerp. The Flemish word for boat is schip, and Schipperke is thus thought to mean little boatman. The breed was less commonly called Schipperke by Belgian townspeople, however, who more often referred to them as spitz.The other plausible theory of origin is that they were a dog of tradesmen guilds and middle-class households, who wanted a small dog to protect their home from rodents. The breed resembles a miniature Belgian Sheepdog, and it is possible that Schipperke derives from the word for shepherd, scheper. In fact, a breed of dog intermediate in size was one known in the region.Although small black tailless dogs are mentioned in Belgian writings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, definite evidence of Schipperkes is not found until 1690. A group of Brussels shoemakers organized regular Schipperke competitions, taking special pride in adorning their companions with ornate brass collars. By the nineteenth century this breed was so popular in central Belgium that they were virtually the only house dog found there, and they were acknowledged as the national dog.In 1885 Queen Marie Henriette acquired a Schipperke she saw at a dog show. After people saw the little dog with her, it sparked great interest in the breed from people of all classes, and the workman’s companion thus became companion to the elite. At the same time, the breed’s numbers were depleted by exports to England, where they had become extremely fashionable. Most people in Belgium considered the breed common and preferred more exotic breeds. In the late 1880s, a group of Belgian Schipperke fans grouped to try to save this breed, setting forth the breed’s desirable points. Soon after, the first Schipperke came to America. They aroused little interest at first, but they have since amassed a modest but loyal following.	The Schipperke can be a bold companion, even though they can sometimes be independent and headstrong. This little dynamo is happiest when busy, poking his nose into every cranny and ever on the lookout for adventure. They are often reserved with strangers and an alert watchdog in the home, detecting strangers or visitors and barking in response. They can make an amiable and pleasant member of the household but needs daily exercise.	The active nature of this breed makes exercise—both mental and physical— imperative. Their small stature makes getting that exercise fairly easy, however. Either a vigorous game in the yard or a moderate walk on leash will usually suffice to meets their needs. Their double coat needs weekly brushing, more when shedding.	35	45	18	20
179	Scottish Deerhound	2	3	2	3	4	3	3	2	2	3	4	1	Hound	Sighthound	Scotland	Middle Ages	Deerhound	The Scottish Deerhound has a body like that of a Greyhound but is of larger size and bone, enabling them to run at great speed using the double-suspension gallop without sacrificing strength and endurance. Their trotting gait is easy and true. Their hair is harsh and crisp, about three to four inches long on their body, ideally close lying. Such a coat imparts a weather- (and dirt-) resistant quality, an essential asset in cold, damp climates.	Among the most aristocratic of breeds, the Scottish Deerhound has been valued by nobility for their prowess in running after deer at least since the sixteenth century. Confusion regarding names makes tracing their exact history before that time difficult, but they are probably a very ancient breed, deriving from ancestral Greyhound roots.Like their smooth-coated Greyhound relative, the rough-coated Deerhound could not be owned by anyone ranked lower than an Earl during the Age of Chivalry. As the stag population declined in England, the larger, rough-coated dogs suited for hunting stag became concentrated where the stag remained plentiful—namely, the Scottish Highlands—where they were valued and sadly, hoarded by Highland chieftains. This unfortunate hoarding resulted in the decline of the breed in the mid 1700s following the collapse of the clan system of Culloden. By the mid 1800s, however, a concerted effort to restore the breed had proved successful, and although their numbers were never great, the health of the dogs was high.The First World War again decimated the breed’s numbers because most of the dogs had been the property of a limited number of large estates, most of which did not survive the war intact. Since then, the Deerhound has remained low in number but a classic in every sense.	The Scottish Deerhound is typically mellow, low-key, and easygoing, a gracious and well-mannered member of the family. Outdoors, they loves to run and may try chase anything that moves. Indoors, they needs plenty of room to stretch on a soft surface. They are often independent but willing to please; they can be extremely sensitive. They can be amiable toward but often reserved with strangers. They can be good with children, other dogs, and usually other pets, if properly socialized and introduced.	The Scottish Deerhound needs a good amount of daily exercise, either a long walk or a hike. They prefer temperate or cool climates and need plenty of quality time and interaction with their family. Scottish Deerhounds usually need soft bedding to avoid callouses. Their crisp coat needs combing one or two times weekly. Some scissoring is optional to neaten up straggling hair or occasional trips to a groomer.	75	110	30	32
180	Scottish Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	1	3	5	5	Terrier	Terrier	Scotland	1800s	Aberdeen Terrier, Scottie	The Scottish Terrier is a short-legged, compact, relatively heavy boned dog, giving the impression of great power in a small package. Their coat is a combination of dense undercoat and extremely hardy and wiry outer coat, about 2 inches in length. Their distinctive eyebrows and beard add to their expression, which is often keen and sharp.	Great confusion exists about the background of the Scottish Terrier, stemming from the early custom of calling all terriers from Scotland Scottish or Scotch Terriers. To further confuse matters, the present Scottish Terrier was once grouped with Skye Terriers, in reference not to the modern Skye Terrier but of a large group of terriers from the Isle of Skye. Whatever the origin, the early Scottish Terriers were definitely a hardy lot of Highlanders.Only in the late 1800s can the Scottish Terrier’s history be confidently documented. Of the several short-legged harsh-coated terriers, the dog now known as the Scottish Terrier was most favored in the Aberdeen area, and so for a time they were called the Aberdeen Terrier. By the 1870s, the situation had become so confusing that a series of protests were made, ultimately leading to a detailed description of how the true Scottish Terrier should appear. Around 1880, the first breed standard was put forth.The first Scotty came to America in 1883. They gradually gained popularity until World War II, after which their popularity soared. The most well-known Scotty in America was Fala, Franklin Roosevelt’s dog, who was his constant companion in life and buried at his side in death. The Scottish Terrier remains a fixture of the Terrier Group, always a favorite in the home.	Nicknamed The Diehard in reference to their rugged character, the Scottish Terrier is a tough, smart, determined character, ready for action. They are often fearless and feisty and may be assertive toward other dogs and animals, if not properly socialized and introduced. They can be reserved, but friendly, with strangers, and devoted to their family. Although independent and stubborn, they are often sensitive. Left alone, they tend to dig and bark.	This is a dog on the lookout for adventure, and he needs some excitement and exercise in his life every day. This can take the form of a moderate walk on leash, a boisterous game, or an off-leash exploration in a fenced-in backyard. Their wire coat needs combing two to three times weekly, plus shaping or professional grooming every three months.	18	22	10	10
181	Sealyham Terrier	2	2	2	3	3	3	3	1	1	4	3	4	Terrier	Terrier	Wales	1800s	\N	The Sealyham Terrier is a short-legged terrier, slightly longer than they are tall. Their body is strong, short-coupled, and substantial, allowing for plenty of flexibility. This combination of short legs with a strong and flexible body allows the Sealyham to maneuver in tight quarters. Their weather-resistant coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat. This is a keen, alert, and determined breed and they often look the part.	Although some evidence exists of a small, white, long-backed terrier imported into Wales in the fifteenth century, the documented history of the Sealyham begins only in the mid 1800s. The only reason the earlier observation receives some credence is that the originator of the breed, Captain John Edwardes of Sealyham House in Pembrokeshire, was a descendant of the family said to have imported the particular dog centuries earlier.Regardless, Captain Edwardes worked from 1850 to 1891 to develop the breed now known as the Sealyham Terrier. The breeds that went into their makeup are a mystery; some suggest that the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Wire Fox Terrier, English White Terrier, and Pembroke Welsh Corgi may have played a role. Whatever the ingredients, the result was a plucky terrier that soon gained notoriety. The AKC recognized the Sealyham in 1911.Demand for these terriers quickly grew, especially because they were still exceptional hunting dogs as well as status symbols. Today the breed’s popularity has waned somewhat, but the Sealyham still retains their many great characteristics.	One of the calmer terriers, the Sealyham is nonetheless ready for action, always happy to investigate, dig, or give chase. They are generally friendly, playful, and outgoing. The Sealyham Terrier can be reserved with strangers, but devoted to their family. They can be stubborn, independent, and can dig if bored.	The Sealyham’s exercise needs are not too demanding, consisting of a short to moderate walk or game session every day. If off leash, this needs to be in a fenced in yard or area because  Sealyham Terriers may tend to follow their nose. This breed is suited for apartment life, preferably with yard access. Their wire coat needs combing two to three times weekly, plus grooming every three months. Dirt shows up on their white coats!	23	24	11	11
183	Shiba Inu	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	4	5	Non-sporting	Spitz	Japan	Ancient times	Brushwood Dog, Japanese Small-size Dog	The Shiba Inu is moderately compact, being slightly longer than they are tall. They have typical traits of dogs from northern heritage: small erect ears, thick fur, powerful body, and curled tail. Their expression is often bold, spirited, and good natured. Their gait is light, quick, and agile, with an effortless, smooth stride. The Shiba Inu’s double coat consists of a strong straight outer coat with a soft undercoat, imparting great insulation.	Native Japanese dogs are divided into six breeds. Of these, the smallest and probably most ancient is the Shiba Inu. In fact, one theory about the name shiba is that it simply denotes small; however, it may also mean brushwood in reference to the brilliant red brushwood trees that so closely matched the breed’s red coat. These theories have resulted in the Shiba’s being nicknamed the little brushwood dog.The origin of the Shiba is unclear; but they are clearly of spitz heritage and may have been used as early as 300 b.c. as a hunting dog in central Japan. Three main types existed and each was named for their area of origin: the Shinshu Shiba (from the Nagano Prefecture), the Mino Shiba (from the Gifu Prefecture), and the Sanin Shiba (from the northeast mainland). After World War II, the breed was nearly lost, and it was further decimated by distemper in 1952. In an attempt to save the Shiba Inu, the different types were interbred, crossing the heavier-boned dogs from mountainous regions with the lighter-boned dogs from other regions. As a result, the Shiba survived as one breed with some variation in bone substance. Since then, Shibas have achieved a staunch following, and their popularity continues to grow.	Bold, independent, and headstrong, the Shiba Inu is brimming with self-confidence. They are lively outdoors, yet calm indoors, as long as they get daily exercise. They are a hardy breed, ready for adventure. Some tend to be headstrong and domineering. Some Shiba Inus may be alert and reserved with strangers.  They can also be quite vocal; some bark a lot.	The Shiba needs a daily workout, either in the form of a vigorous game in the yard, a long walk, or a good run in a fenced area. Thier double coat needs brushing one or two times weekly, more when shedding.	20	20	13	16
184	Shih Tzu	3	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	5	3	Toy	Oriental	China, Tibet	Ancient times	Chrysanthemum Dog	Compact, yet slightly longer than they are tall, the Shih Tzu hides a sturdy body beneath their mantle of luxurious hair. They have a smooth, effortless stride with good reach and drive. Their expression is often warm, sweet, and wideeyed, imparting the impression of trust and friendliness. Their long, dense coat is double and fairly straight.	The Shih Tzu (or more properly, Shih Tzu Kou) means Lion Dog, designating the breed as one of the most esteemed animals in China because of its association with Buddhism. Even though the Shih Tzu is most often associated with China, they probably originated in Tibet as early as the seventeenth century, where they enjoyed status as a holy dog.The Shih Tzu as they are known today developed most distinctively in China during the reign of the Dowager Empress Cixi (Tz’u-shi, 1861–1908). The Shih Tzu and Pekingese share similar histories; however, the Shih Tzu can usually be differentiated from the Pekingese in Chinese art by the presence of bumps on the tops of their head, denoting a topknot, or pien-ji. The Shih Tzu was a favored house pet during the Ming dynasty and was highly prized by the royal family.When the British looted the Imperial Palace, most of the dogs were lost, and the breed suffered a great setback. The Shih Tzu was first exhibited in China as the Lhassa Terrier or Tibetan Poodle. In 1935, they were exhibited as the Lhassa Lion Dog; by that time, they were becoming very popular.A similar state of confusion existed in England, where the Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu were both lumped together as the Apso (meaning shaggy). In 1934 they were divided into two separate breeds, with the smaller, wider-skulled, shorter-nosed dogs from Peking dubbed Shih Tzu, their colloquial Chinese name. In the United States, the breed began to become extremely popular in the 1960s, leading to AKC recognition in 1969. Their popularity has continued to grow, and they are one of the most popular toy breeds.	The spunky but sweet Shih Tzu can be both a gentle lapdog and a vivacious companion. They have an upbeat attitude and love to play and romp. They are affectionate to their family and often good with children. They can be surprisingly tough and may have a stubborn streak.	Despite their small size, Shih Tzus need daily exercise. Because of their small size, they can meet their requirements with vigorous indoor games or with short walks on leash. They do not do well in hot humid weather. Their luxurious coat needs brushing or combing every other day. They may need professional grooming.	17	23	14	17
185	Siberian Husky	3	4	4	4	3	3	5	1	1	3	5	3	Working	Northern	Russia (Siberia)	Ancient times	Arctic Husky	The Siberian Husky combines power, speed, and endurance. They are moderately compact, slightly longer than they are tall, and of definite Northern heritage. They are quick and light on their feet, with a smooth and effortless stride exhibiting both good reach and drive. They have a double coat of medium length, with a soft, dense undercoat and straight, somewhat flat-lying outer coat. Their expression is often keen but friendly, interested, and sometimes even mischievous.	The Chukchi people of northeast Asia developed the breed now known as the Siberian Husky. Their ancestry is unknown, but they are of obvious spitz origins, evolved over hundreds of years as a sledge dog for these nomadic people. During the Alaskan gold rush, dogs became a vital part of life in the Arctic regions.In 1909 the first Chukchi huskies were brought to North America from Siberia for The All-Alaska sweepstakes race. Smaller and more docile than most of the other competitors in the race, they aroused little admiration, with the exception of one racer who was so impressed he imported seventy to train for the 1910 race. Throughout the rest of the year, the dogs earned their keep as utilitarian sledders, but it was in 1925 that they gained their greatest acclaim. Teams of Huskies raced 340 miles with life-saving serum for diphtheria stricken Nome, AK and were credited with saving the town. A statue in their honor stands in Central Park.The first Siberian Huskies came to Canada, and then the rest of the United States, at around this time. The AKC recognized the breed in 1930. During World War II, many Siberians served in the U.S. Army’s Search and Rescue teams, further capturing the public’s admiration. The breed’s popularity continued to grow and now this breed is cherished family pet. They remain one of the most popular of the Arctic breeds.	Fun-loving, adventurous, alert, independent, clever, stubborn, mischievous, and obstinate all describe the Siberian Husky. This breed loves to run and will roam if given the chance. They may be very assertive toward strange dogs, but they are generally good with other dogs in the home. In fact, they are very social and must have lots of human or canine companionship. They may chase strange cats or small pets. Some are likely to howl, dig, and chew.	This is a very active dog. They need ample daily exercise, either in the form of a long jog, hike or a long run off-leash in a safe and enclosed area. They also love to pull and tend to enjoy cold weather. Their coat needs brushing one or two times a week, daily during periods of heaviest shedding.	9	16	8	11
186	Silky Terrier	4	2	4	3	3	3	3	1	3	3	3	5	Toy	Terrier	Australia	Late 1800s	Sydney Silky, Australian Silky Terrier	The Silky Terrier is a miniature version of a working terrier, and as such retains many similar features. They are somewhat longer than tall, and though of refined bone, they often nonetheless have sufficient strength and substance. Their gait is free and light-footed; their expression is often piercingly keen. Their straight, single coat is silky and glossy, following the body outline rather than falling to the floor.	In the late 1800s, Yorkshire Terriers were brought to Australia from England. These dogs had striking steel blue and tan coat coloration and were bred with the native blue and tan Australian Terriers in an effort to improve the latter’s coat color. Both the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier were rather recent developments, being the product of mixing a number of other terrier breeds. A few of these dogs were given a new name, Silky Terriers, because it was felt that they were the beginning of a separate breed, with an intermediate size and coat length.Because the breed was developed in two separate areas of Australia, these dogs could vary in size and weight. In 1926, a revised standard encompassing all areas was accepted, with accepted weights being somewhat of a compromise. The breed was popularly known as the Sydney Silky Terrier in Australia until it was changed to Australian Silky Terrier in 1955. In America, the name was changed to Silky Terrier in 1955 as well. Although not a rare breed, the Silky Terrier has been somewhat slow to attract admirers and they are only moderately popular.	The Silky Terrier is no mellow lapdog. They are often bold, feisty, inquisitive, and playful, ever ready for action—a terrier at heart. They can be assertive toward other dogs or pets. They are often clever, but can tend to be stubborn, and can be mischievous. They tend to bark a lot.	This is an active breed requiring slightly more exercise than other small breeds. They enjoy a moderate walk on leash, but they especially like the chance to nose around on their own in a safe area, such as a fenced yard. Much of their exercise requirements can be met with vigorous indoor games or walk outside. Their coat needs brushing or combing every other day.	35	60	20	24
187	Skye Terrier	2	2	3	4	1	1	1	1	3	3	4	5	Terrier	Terrier	Scotland	1500s	\N	The Skye Terrier is a stylish and elegant dog. They are solidly built, with substantial bone, and twice as long as they are tall. The Skye Terrier often has short legs and a long back. Their movement is free and effortless. Their hard outer coat and close undercoat can help provide some protection from inclement weather. Their outer coat lies straight and flat, 5.5 inches or more in length. Their hair often covers their forehead and eyes.	Scotland has long been a stronghold of small plucky terriers, and the Skye Terrier is among the oldest of them. They developed along the west coastal area, where they hunted from the rocky cairns. The origin of these dogs was on the Isle of Skye, and the dogs were thus dubbed Skye Terriers.They were first described in the sixteenth century, when they were already noteworthy for their long coat. Some confusion exists in tracing their history because, for a time, several different breeds were grouped under the name Skye Terrier. The true Skye Terrier became prominent in 1840 when Queen Victoria enjoyed the breed, keeping both drop- and prick-eared dogs. This enhanced their popularity both in high society and among commoners, and the Skye soon came to America. The AKC recognized the breed in 1887.Despite the breed’s distinctive appearance, their popularity has waned, and they are now among the least known terriers. The most famous Skye of all time was Greyfriar’s Bobby, who slept on Greyfriar’s grave for 14 years until his own death; he continues his vigil still, having been buried along side him. A statue commemorates this most loyal of dogs.	The Skye Terrier’s soft look belies their tough nature. They are a mild-mannered member of the family, one of the few terriers calm enough to live in the city. They still need daily exercise and a walk however. They can be sensitive yet stubborn. The Skye is affectionate with their family but cautious with strangers. They tend to get along fairly well with other dogs in the same household but may not mingle well with strange dogs. They are extremely courageous and can make a good watchdog in the home, detecting strangers or visitors and barking in response.	These dogs enjoy a daily outing, exploring in a safe area, such as a fenced yard. They also need a short to moderate walk to stay in shape. Regular combing (about twice a week) is all that is needed to keep the Skye looking good. An occasional bath will not soften their coat too much, as is often the case with other terriers. The hair around their eyes and mouth may need extra cleaning.	8	11	9	10
188	Sloughi	3	4	3	3	2	1	2	2	2	1	2	2	Sighthound	Hound (AKC), Sighthound & Pariah (UKC)	Africa	Unknown	\N	The Sloughi is an ancient African sighthound originally bred to hunt wild game, including hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, ostrich and wild pigs. This robust, elegant breed is prized for his speed, agility, endurance and supreme hunting ability and exudes grace and class. Athletic and medium to large in size, the Sloughi is smooth-coated and short-haired with a noble attitude and gentle expression.	The Sloughi originated in North Africa, in the area including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, as a sighthound to hunt game such as hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, ostrich and wild pigs, and serve as companion to the nomadic Berber people. By the end of the 19th century, the first Sloughis arrived in Europe and became recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. In 1973, the Sloughi was imported to the United States for the first time. The breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1995 and later by the American Kennel Club in 2016.	The Sloughi is an ancient African sighthound originally bred to hunt wild game, including hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, ostrich and wild pigs. Prized for his class, grace and nobility, the Sloughi is intelligent, driven and loyal, though he sometimes can be aloof and shy among strangers. He is active and athletic, yet reserved and well-mannered in the house. Sensitive, proud and independent, the Sloughi bonds very closely with his human family, and is quite affectionate and gentle with those he loves.	The Sloughi is a clever, active and athletic breed built for speed that should be given plenty of supervised exercise, especially free running in a fenced yard. Keep in mind the Sloughi is a true sighthound and thus has a strong prey drive, so walks should always be on a leash and contact with small dogs or cats should be avoided. The Sloughi has a smooth, fine, short coat that requires minimal grooming — weekly brushing and the occasional bath is all it takes to keep his coat clean and sleek. His teeth should be brushed regularly and ears cleaned and checked often for signs of infection.	25	40	10	10
189	Small Munsterlander	4	5	4	5	5	3	3	3	5	3	2	3	Spaniel	Gun Dog (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Germany	19th century	Small Munsterlander Pointer, Kleiner Münsterländer	This versatile hunting dog is prized for his elegant style, characterized by skillful retrieving, staunch pointing and meticulous tracking. Capable of enduring even the most difficult conditions on land and in water, the Small Munsterlander uses his wagging, horizontally carried tail to signal game. His smooth, feathered coat can either be brown-and-white or roan (brown-and-white with brown ticking).	His exact origin unknown, the Small Munsterlander is believed to have been developed during the 19th century in the Münster region of northern Germany, where the breed was nicknamed “little spy” for his tenacity and intelligence in the field. Besides his ability to perform numerous hunting-related tasks, the Small Munsterlander also was developed as a supreme family companion. This multipurpose breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club as a member of the Gun Dog Group in 2006 and continues to be a part of the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service throughout its development.	Confident and eager to please, the Small Munsterlander is an equally devoted hunting partner and steady, calm family companion. He is intelligent, alert and friendly, and good with children, provided he’s properly socialized and raised with them from the start. Joyful and adaptable, the Small Munsterlander relishes in plenty of attention and affection from his human family and prefers to be by his master’s side as much as possible.	The occasional brushing and bath is all it takes to keep the Small Munsterlander’s coat in tiptop shape. Keep in mind he sheds seasonally, typically in the late spring and early fall, during which more frequent brushing and bathing may be necessary. In addition, his nails should be trimmed, ears checked and cleaned and teeth brushed regularly. The Small Munsterlander also needs regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep him occupied, such as daily supervised free running or playtime in a large fenced yard. He’s happiest when hunting, but also excels at agility, obedience, retrieving and hunting tests or trials.	35	50	24	29
190	Smooth Fox Terrier	4	3	4	4	3	2	4	1	4	1	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1700s	\N	The Smooth Fox Terrier is energetic and playful, and needs a safe environment where they can run and exercise. This breed does best living in the house, with plenty of time to play in the yard.	The Smooth Fox Terrier’s ancestors are not documented, but the breed was certainly known by 1800. Predominantly white dogs were preferred because they could be more easily distinguished from the quarry in dim lighting. Some speculation exists that the Smooth and Wire Fox Terriers arose from distinct backgrounds, with the Smooth descending from the smoothcoated Black and Tan, the Bull Terrier, and even the Greyhound and Beagle.The Smooth Fox Terriers were among the first breeds to enter the show ring, classified initially with the Sporting breeds. The two varieties were interbred extensively at one time, but the practice gradually declined. Because the two breeds had long since ceased to be crossed by the latter part of the 1900s, the AKC divided them into separate breeds in 1985.	Energetic, inquisitive, bold, feisty, playful, mischievous, independent, and adventurous describe the Fox Terrier. This breed lives to run, chase, and explore. He is usually fairly reserved with strangers. He tends to bark and dig.	The Smooth Fox Terrier is energetic and cannot be ignored. As an active dog, he will do much to exercise himself given the room. He enjoys a vigorous game or walk, as well as an off-lead outing in a safe area. Smooth coat care consists of weekly brushing to remove shedding hair. In fact, the Smooths shed more than the Wires.	45	60	20	23
191	Wheaten Terrier	3	3	4	5	3	3	4	2	3	4	5	4	Terrier	Terrier	Ireland	1700s	\N	The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is an all-around dog, square-proportioned, graceful, and strong, not exaggerated in any way. Their gait is free and lively with good reach and drive; their tail held erect. Their abundant, soft, single coat distinguishes them from all other terriers. Their wavy coat is not evident in youngsters. It is long and silky with a gentle wave. Their overall appearance is often one of grace and strength in an alert and happy dog.	One of only three large terriers of Ireland, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier originated as an all-around farm dog, perhaps serving in this function for hundreds of years. Besides the ever-essential terrier function of protecting the home or farm from rodents, they also helped round up stock and guard the homestead.Their early history is largely undocumented; however, they are mentioned as a progenitor of the Kerry Blue Terrier. In 1937 they were granted official breed status in Ireland. The English Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1943, and in 1946 the first Wheaten Terrier came to America. They did not instantly catch the public’s attention, but instead they took their time building a firm basis of support. In 1973 the AKC granted recognition. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has remained a breed of only moderate popularity.	The Wheaten Terrier is a playful companion. They are often affectionate, congenial, and much gentler than most terriers. They are generally responsive to their family but can be headstrong at times. They are generally good and patient with children (although some may be overly boisterous with small children) and usually very friendly with other household dogs and pets. They may dig or jump. They can be one of the quietest terriers, barking only for real alarms.	This is an athletic dog that needs a good daily workout, either in the form of a moderate to long walk or an invigorating game in the yard. They should be allowed loose only in a safe area or fenced yard because they are prone to chase. Their long coat needs brushing or combing every two days. As a nonshedding dog, loose hair becomes entangled in their coat and will mat if not combed out. Bathing and trimming every other month is necessary to maintain their health and they may require some professional grooming.	15	19	16	16
192	Spanish Water Dog	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	4	5	2	2	5	Herding	Water Dog	Spain	At least 1100s	Perro de Agua Espanol, Turco Andaluz	The Spanish Water Dog is a sturdy, medium-sized athlete. They are solidly built and are slightly longer than tall. Their coat is a single coat with distinctly curly hair with wooly texture, adapted to the variable humidity and drought conditions of their homeland. Their coat is usually not brushed but allowed to form curls or cords that cover the entire body, including their head. Their movement is effortless and ground covering, with good reach and drive.	The early history of the Spanish Water Dog is largely speculative, with various theories having their ancestors arising in North Africa, Turkey, Hungary, and even Spain. By 1100 a.d., there are clear references to these dogs in literature. They were used for different tasks in different parts of the Iberian Peninsula. In the northern coastal regions and fishing ports they were all-purpose water dogs, jumping in the water to retrieve fishing tackle, nets, and mooring lines. They may have also been used as hunting dogs. In the central and southern regions they herded and protected sheep, goats, and cattle, and again, perhaps hunted small animals.The Industrial Revolution in Spain gradually drove many dogs out of work, with some jobs being taken over by mechanized means and by destroying coastal fishing areas from pollution. Some dogs remained working as herders, and in 1975 two people began an effort to revive the breed. They gathered dogs from all regions, but they mostly gathered Andalucian herding dogs. By 1980 a Spanish Water Dog club was established in Spain, and in 1985 the Spanish Kennel Club recognized the breed. In the United States, the AKC recognized them in 2015. They are an incredibly versatile breed and sometimes participate as search and rescue dogs and as drug detection dogs.	This high-energy breed often likes activity and challenges. They are intelligent and have a  desire to please, and are thus often highly trainable.  They can be very affectionate and like to constantly be with their family. They generally get along well with other dogs and pets but can be naturally suspicious of strangers. The Spanish Water Dog can be protective of their home and family. Like many herding dogs, Spanish Water Dogs can herd children and can be overly sensitive to sudden stimuli. In the home they are likely to be alert dogs, detecting strangers or visitors and bark in response.	The Spanish Water Dog needs daily mental and physical challenges that can be met with a long walk, jog, or vigorous games, plus activities like agility. Given adequate exercise, they are usually a calm member of the household. The Spanish Water Dog has a non-shedding coat that, over time, tends to form cords. They shouldn’t be brushed, and when bathed they should be blotted, not rubbed, dry. The Spanish Water Dog was traditionally sheared once per year, along with the sheep, but now their coat is maintained between one and five inches in length.	31	48	16	20
193	Spinone Italiano	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	1	3	2	3	4	Sporting	Pointer	Italy	1200s	Italian Griffon	The Spinone Italiano has a hound look about them, with a fairly long head and muzzle, large, dropped ears, and somewhat pendulous lips.  They are a strong, muscular dog, able to trot at fast pace. Their dense wiry coat allows them to hike under many conditions. Their coat is generally single, consisting of rough, dry, thick hair about 1.5 to 2.5” in length. Longer hair garnishing their lips and eyebrows adds further protection in addition to adding to their often intelligent and gentle expression.	The Spinone Italiano is one of the earliest breeds developed as a pointing dog, with evidence of wirehaired pointing dogs dating as far back as 500 b.c. Dogs resembling the Spinone Italiano can be found in artwork of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italy. Still, their exact origin remains a mystery, although some believe they arose from Celtic wirehaired breeds, whereas others place their origins with Greek traders who brought them to Italy during the times of the Roman Empire.Unfortunately, few records remain of the breed’s subsequent development, even though present day Spinone Italiano traces back principally to Italy’s Piedmont region. They proved themselves adept at penetrating thorny cover and finding small animals. During World War II, the Spinone further distinguished themselves by tracking German patrols. The end of the war found the breed in trouble, however, because their numbers had been decimated and many of the remaining dogs mixed with other breeds. The Spinone Italiano was in danger of being lost.In the 1950s, some began a concerted effort to reconstruct the Spinone Italiano. They are now a popular dog in Italy and some other European countries, but they have been slower to attract attention in America. The Spinone Italiano gained AKC status in 2000. The word Spinone is derived from pino, an Italian thorn bush through which these tough-skinned dogs could historically hunt. The plural form is Spinoni (Spi-no-ni); the singular is Spinone (Spi-no-nay).	Spinone Italiani are generally devoted and gentle dogs, very willing to please. They are affectionate and often get along well with other dogs, pets and children. They are also oftentimes courageous. The Spinone is generally calmer and easier going than most pointing breeds.	The Spinone Italiano needs daily exercise. This can take the form of a long walk or good run off leash in a safe place like a fenced yard. Their coat care consists of weekly brushing, plus occasional professional groom to trim their face and feet.	62	82	22	27
194	Staffordshire Bull Terrier	3	3	5	4	2	3	3	3	3	1	4	3	Terrier	Terrier, Mastiff	England	1800s	\N	The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is slightly longer than they are tall, and relatively wide, giving them a low center of gravity and firm stance. Their small size imparts a surprising agility, while their heavy musculature provides great strength. Their head is wide and their gait is powerful and agile. Their coat is smooth, short, and close.	In the early 1800s, the Bulldog of the time was mixed with the Black and Tan Terrier, thus producing the Bull and Terrier, a fearless, quick and strong dog. From there, selective breeding resulted in a small, nimble dog with great strength. Efforts to produce an attractive pet resulted in the Staffordshire Bull Terrier’s recognition by the English Kennel Club in 1935 and in 1974 the AKC confirmed similar status. Those who live with Staffordshire Bull Terriers know them to be loving members of the family.	The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a fun-loving character that loves playing with their family and friends. They are typically playful, companionable, amiable, docile, and generally responsive to their family. Their love of a good game is rivaled only by their need for human companionship. They are also characteristically friendly toward strangers. Some can be strong willed. They can be fearless and tenacious. They may not do well around strange dogs or sometimes even household dogs that are assertive. They are generally very good with children; although usually gentle, some can be rambunctious. In the United Kingdom the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is known as the Nanny Dog, in reference to their eagerness and ability to get along with children in the home.	This is an athletic breed that needs a good walk on leash every day. They also enjoy a good game in the yard or a run in a safe area, such as a fenced yard. Most Staffordshire Bull Terriers are poor swimmers. Their coat care is minimal.	24	38	14	16
195	Schnauzer	4	3	3	2	2	3	1	5	3	4	3	5	Working	Schnauzer, Terrier	Germany	Middle Ages	Mittelshnauzer	This is a robust, sturdily built, heavyset dog of square proportion. They are both strong and agile, with a  quick, powerful stride. Their coat is hard, wiry, and thick, with soft undercoat. Their hallmark whiskers, mustache, and eyebrows add to their often alert, spirited expression.	The Standard Schnauzer is the prototypical Schnauzer, the oldest of the three breeds. Definite evidence of the breed exists as early as the fourteenth century; even then, they were appreciated as a household pet and hunting companion. The breed is a fortuitous blend of terrier, working, and hunting breeds, most likely originating from the mixing of Wire-haired Pinschers with black German Poodles and gray wolf spitz. The result was a hardy dog able to protect the farm from rodents and who also protected the home.By the beginning of the twentieth century, they were the most popular dogs for guarding farmers’ carts at the marketplace while the farmers were elsewhere. The first Schnauzers were recognized as Wirehaired Pinschers at an 1879 German show. Their smart looks quickly enamored them to people, and they became very popular by 1900.Although the first Schnauzers came to America by this time, they were slower to catch on with Americans.  The breed was initially classified as a terrier, but they were later reclassified as a working dog. Their alert and intelligent nature gained them a role as dispatch carrier and aide during World War I. Like the larger Giant Schnauzer, the Standard Schnauzer also participated in police work. Only after World War II did they gain more public attention; even so, they have not achieved the popularity of the other Schnauzers.	Bold and lively, the Standard Schnauzer is a fun-loving companion. They can be clever and headstrong, and unless given daily physical and mental exercise, they can be mischievous. They do best when shown patience and structure. They are a devoted family dog and can be very reliable with children. They are often good with family pets, but they can be assertive with strange dogs, animals, or small pets. They are typically reserved with strangers, sometimes acting suspicious.	The Standard Schnauzer needs daily exercise, either a long walk on leash, a vigorous game, or hike. Their coat needs combing twice weekly, plus professional occasional professional grooming.	35	45	13	15
196	Sussex Spaniel	3	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	4	Sporting	Spaniel	England	1800s	\N	The Sussex Spaniel tend to have a long, low, “rectangular” body, coupled with a muscular and rather massive physique. Their movement is deliberate and rolling because of their short legs and comparatively wide body, a gait that emphasizes power over speed. Their abundant body coat is flat or slightly wavy. A distinctive feature is the long feather between their toes, which is oftentimes long enough to cover the toenails. Their expression can be somber and serious, even frowning, but their wagging tail belies their true nature. The Sussex Spaniel tends to bark.	The “Spaniels of Sussex” are mentioned in a sporting publication of 1820 as good working dogs. Their name was adopted from Sussex, England. This breed soon became popular among the estates around Sussex County. They were adept as upland working dogs, slow working but with a good nose and apt to give tongue when on scent. Although one of the first ten AKC-recognized breeds, the Sussex Spaniel has never been a particularly popular. Perhaps because of these reasons, the Sussex Spaniel has been perilously close to extinction throughout most of the twentieth century and is still among the rarest of the recognized breeds.	The Sussex Spaniel is more laid back than other spaniels. This makes them well suited for city life, but they still appreciate and need daily exercise. They may be noisier than other spaniels. If left alone while other activities are ongoing, they may feel left out and bark or howl. They are usually calm, steady, and easygoing members of the household. Their somber expression is misleading because  they are often quite cheerful.	The Sussex Spaniel needs daily exercise, but their needs can be met with a good walk or a short romp in a fenced yard. Given the chance, they will appreciate a longer walk. Their coat typically needs brushing and combing two to three times a week.	22	35	12	14
197	Swedish Vallhund	4	4	4	5	3	3	3	2	4	2	3	5	Herding	Spitz	Sweden	Viking times	Västgötaspets	The Swedish Vallhund is low to the ground (height to length of body is 2:3). They are longer legged, shorter bodied, and less stocky compared to Corgis, giving them slightly more speed and agility. Their teeth can be large for their skull. Their medium-length coat is double, with coarse guard hairs and an insulating undercoat. Their tails vary in length.	The Swedish Vallhund, sometimes referred to as “the little Viking dog,” is a dwarf spitz breed that has been used as a farm dog for centuries, possibly since Viking times, when they were known as the Vikingarnas Dog. They herded cattle, protected the home and farm from rodents, and acted as a watchdog.Very little is known of this breed’s early history. By 1942, they were almost extinct. Count Bjorn Von Rosen and Karl Gustav Zettersten, began an effort to save the breed, locating one male (named Mopsen) and three females (named Vivi, Lessi, and Topsy), which they hoped would revive the breed.They were recognized by the Swedish Kennel Club as the Svensk Vallhund, which translates to Swedish herder. The name was changed in 1964 to Västgötaspets, named after the Swedish province Vastergotland where this breed was revived. The first Vallhunds came to England in 1974, then to the United States from England in 1983. They entered the AKC Herding Group in 2007, but have remained mostly unknown to the general public. The breed is often known for their hardiness and health.	The Swedish Vallhund is a confident dog that doesn’t let their short stature hold them back. They are often energetic and playful when circumstances allow, but calm and mellow when they need be. They can learn quickly and can be eager to please, but have a streak of independence. They often enjoy mental challenges and can be sometimes too inquisitive. They are sweet but not fawning. They usually get along well with other dogs and animals. They tend to be good with considerate children, but can nip heels in play. They may be wary of strangers. They can tend to bark enthusiastically and will detect strangers or visitors and alert their family.	Swedish Vallhunds need a medium to high level of activity. A long walk or short jog, along with a mentally challenging game, will usually satisfy their exercise needs. They also enjoy agility. Their coat care consists of weekly brushing. They may enjoy cooler weather but can enjoy warmer weather as well.	35	75	20	24
198	Thai Ridgeback	3	4	3	2	2	1	1	1	2	1	1	2	Pariah	Sighthound & Pariah (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Thailand	Unknown	\N	A muscular, medium-sized, pariah-type dog, the Thai Ridgeback has a wedge-shaped head, prick ears, spotted or solid black or blue tongue, smooth and short coat in an array of colors with a tail that’s held vertically or curved upward. His distinct ridge on the back, which can be arranged in one of eight different patterns, is formed by hair growing in the opposite direction from the rest of his coat. Agile and athletic, with an impressive jumping ability, he was bred for hunting and guarding. The Thai Ridgeback maintains those same talents today and also is suitable as a companion dog.	The Thai Ridgeback’s origin is shrouded in mystery, though we do know the breed was developed in Thailand, hence the name. Early writings describing the Thai Ridgeback date back to the 17th century, positioning the breed with a ridge of hair running down his back as a hunting and guard dog. Although the United Kennel Club has recognized the breed since 1996, and the American Kennel Club recognizes the breed as part of its Foundation Stock Service, the Thai Ridgeback remains a relatively rare breed outside of Thailand.	A muscular, medium-sized, pariah-type dog, the Thai Ridgeback has a wedge-shaped head, prick ears, spotted or solid black or blue tongue, smooth and short coat in an array of colors with a tail that’s held vertically or curved upward. His distinct ridge on the back, which can be arranged in one of eight different patterns, is formed by hair growing in the opposite direction from the rest of his coat. Agile and athletic, with an impressive jumping ability, he was bred for hunting and guarding. The Thai Ridgeback maintains those same talents today and also is suitable as a companion dog.	The Thai Ridgeback has a short, straight coat that seasonally sheds, typically twice a year at most, thus requiring frequent brushing during that time. Otherwise, occasional brushing and bathing, as well as regular nail trimming, teeth brushing and ear cleaning, will keep the Thai Ridgeback looking his best. Energetic and playful, the Thai Ridgeback should be given plenty of exercise, whether it’s free play or running in a fenced yard or taken on several daily walks. He also enjoys swimming, hiking and retrieving, and can be trained for agility, obedience and rally.	80	150	24	26
199	Tibetan Mastiff	2	2	3	4	3	3	2	5	2	3	4	5	Working	Mastiff	Tibet	Ancient times	Do-khyi	A powerful, heavy, but athletic dog, the Tibetan Mastiff is built to combine strength and agility. Their body is slightly longer than they are tall. Their walk is slow and deliberate, while its trot is powerful and light-footed. Their whole appearance is impressive, with a solemn but kindly expression. Their coat, which is noticeably heavier in males than in females, is thick and fairly long, especially around the neck and shoulders. Their tail is densely coated and the hind legs feathered on the upper parts. Their hair is coarse, straight, and hard, standing off from the body. They carry a heavy undercoat in cold weather but little undercoat in warm weather. This combination of coat types allowed the Tibetan Mastiff to endure the extremes of Tibetan weather.	Among the most ancient and influential of breeds, the Tibetan Mastiff’s origins have long been lost. Archaeological evidence of massive dogs dating to 1100 b.c. can be found in China; such dogs may have traveled with Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan, providing the origins for mastiffs in Central Asia. Those on the Himalayan plateaus developed into camp guardians of nomadic herdsmen. Their nomadic lifestyle furthered their distribution, but the high mountains separating plateaus and valleys created isolated populations. Thus, a wide range of dogs emerged, with hardiness and guarding ability guiding selection.Besides protecting the campsites, dogs were used to protect villages and monasteries. The breed remained largely unknown outside their native Tibet until 1847, when the Viceroy of India sent a large dog from Tibet named Siring to Queen Victoria; they gained greater exposure when two dogs imported by the Prince of Wales in 1874.With few dogs outside their native country, the breed’s future was threatened when China invaded Tibet in the 1950s, displacing the native dogs. Survival depended on fleeing to neighboring countries or retreating to isolated mountain villages. The Dalai Lama sent two dogs to President Eisenhower, but they soon disappeared into obscurity. Only in the 1970s did dogs from Nepal and India arrive in America. These dogs came from a wide genetic base, accounting for the natural variation in size and style in the breed today.	As befitting their long past as a solitary sentry, Tibetan Mastiffs are oftentimes independent and strong willed. They can be aloof toward strangers but devoted to their family. Proper socialization is essential so that they will accept strangers and not become overly suspicious. They are gentle and patient with their children, but may assertive with those outside of the family. They are generally good with other dogs. Most Tibetan Mastiffs are good with other animals.	The Tibetan Mastiff tends to be calm indoors and moderately active outside. A long daily leash walk along with access to a fenced, outdoor yard should meet their needs. Grooming typically consists of brushing a few times a week (daily during shedding), paying special attention to the longer hair. They often enjoy cooler temperatures and are not suited for hot, humid weather. They like to bark loudly at night.	9	15	10	10
200	Tibetan Spaniel	3	2	3	3	4	4	1	1	3	3	4	5	Non-sporting	Oriental	Tibet	Ancient times	\N	The Tibetan Spaniel is slightly longer than they are tall. Their head is small in proportion to their body; their wide eye set gives them an expressive face. Their mouth is undershot. Their gait is quick moving, straight, and free. Their coat is double, with a flat-lying, silky outer coat of moderate length. Their tail is usually plumed, and long feathering grows from between their toes.	The Tibetan Spaniel’s history is interwoven with the Buddhist beliefs of Tibet. The Lamaist form of Buddhism regarded the lion as an important symbol, as it was said to follow Buddha like a dog. The little lion-like dogs that followed the Lamas were regarded as symbols of the sacred lion and were thus highly valued. The Chinese also cultivated a lion dog, the Pekingese, and dogs from each country were often presented between countries.The Tibetan Spaniel largely originated from the monasteries, which usually had the smallest sized dogs. These little dogs served more than a decorative purpose; they perched on the monastery walls and sounded the alarm when strangers or wolves approached. They also served as prayer dogs, turning the prayer wheels by means of small treadmills.Although the first Tibetan Spaniel came to England in the late 1800s, they largely were unknown until 1920s, when the Griegs (known for promoting the Tibetan Spaniel) obtained several of these dogs. Only one of their dogs, Skyid, survived World War II, but his descendants can still be found. The start of most Western Tibetan Spaniels dates from around 1940, when several dogs came to England by way of an English couple living in Sikkim. It wasn’t until the 1960s that this breed came to America, and in 1984 it received AKC recognition. This sacred dog has been slow to gain fans, but they are worshiped by those who have adopted them.	The Tibetan Spaniel is independent, bold, and stubborn, but they are also sensitive and amenable. They often have a happy attitude, enjoying games and outings with their family. They also tend to enjoy snoozes next to their special person. They are an exceptionally enjoyable and fastidious member of the household. They are usually amiable with other dogs and pets, but can be reserved with strangers.	The Tibetan Spaniel’s exercise needs can be fairly minimal, but daily. Their needs may be met by games inside the house or fenced yard, or with a short walk on leash. This breed is often well suited for apartment life and usually does not like hot weather. Their coat needs brushing and combing twice weekly.	18	24	15	16
201	Tibetan Terrier	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	1	3	4	3	4	Non-sporting	Oriental	Tibet	Ancient times	Dhokhi Apso	The Tibetan Terrier was historically viewed as an all-purpose dog, able to accompany their family on any job. They are usually square-proportioned, compact, and powerfully built. Their double coat, consists of a profuse fine, long (straight or slightly wavy) outer coat and a soft wooly undercoat, which provided protection from the harsh Tibetan climate. Long hair falls forward over their eyes and foreface. Their feet are large, flat, and round, producing a snowshoe effect for maximum traction. Their stride is free and effortless.	The history of the Tibetan Terrier is as shrouded in mystery as the mountains and valleys from whence they come. The Tibetan Terrier originated in Lamaist monasteries nearly 2000 years ago. These dogs were kept not as workers, but as family companions that might occasionally help out with the herding or other farm chores. They were known as “luck bringers” or “holy dogs.”Much of the breed’s history is speculation or myth; one story claims that a major access route to their valley was obliterated by an earthquake in the fourteenth century. Few visitors hazarded the treacherous journey to the “Lost Valley” after that; the few that did were often given a luckbringer dog to help them on their return trip. As befitting any bringer of luck, these dogs were never sold, but they were often presented as special gifts of gratitude. So it was that in 1920 Dr. A. Grieg, an Indian physician, was given one of the special dogs in return for medical treatment. Dr. Grieg became interested in the breed and began to promote them.The Tibetan Terrier first became recognized in India, and by 1937 they had made their way to England. From there, they came to America in the 1950s and was admitted to AKC registration in 1973. Incidentally, the Tibetan Terrier is in no way a terrier, having only been given that name because of their terrier size.	Gentle and amiable, the Tibetan Terrier makes a charming, dependable member of the household. They are equally up for an adventure in the yard or a snooze in the house. They can be sensitive, a wonderful companion and willing to please.	The Tibetan Terrier often likes to run and explore, and needs daily exercise in a safe area, such as a fenced yard. Their needs can also be met by a vigorous game in the yard or a moderately long walk on leash. Their long coat needs thorough brushing or combing once or twice a week.	100	200	21	24
202	Tosa	2	2	3	3	1	2	1	5	2	1	2	2	Mastiff	Guardian (UKC), Foundation Stock Service (AKC)	Japan	1850s	Tosa Ken, Tosa Inu, Tosa Dog, Tosa Token, Japanese Mastiff, Japanese Fighting Dog	Formerly bred for dog fighting but now primarily used as a watchdog, the Tosa is the largest of all Japanese dog breeds and is known for having a powerful, hardy build with a regal stature. The Tosa has a board, wrinkly head with a boxy muzzle, high drop-set ears and a tapered tail. His short, dense coat can be fawn, red, apricot, black or brindle, with or without white markings on his chest and/or feet. The Tosa’s appearance gives the impression of a true dynamic athlete and warrior.	With the growing popularity of dog fighting in Japan in the 14th century, Japanese dog fanciers and dog fighters began to obtain foreign dogs to cross with their native stock following Commodore Perry’s arrival in Japan in 1854. These mastiff-type breeds included the Bulldog, Mastiff, German Pointer and Great Dane, as well as the Shikoku, a native to Japan. The breed was named the Tosa for the region, the Tosa Province on the Shikoku Island, in which it was bred and developed. Today, the Tosa is highly regarded in Japan as the canine version of a Sumo wrestler, while the breed primarily serves as a companion and guardian in the United States. The United Kennel Club has recognized the Tosa Ken as a member of the Guardian Dog Group since 1998, and the breed continues to be part of the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service throughout its further development.	Bold and courageous, yet quiet and composed, the Tosa has a calm and dignified demeanor. He is patient, affectionate and obedient with his human family, making for a vigilant watchdog and wonderful companion. The Tosa is wary of strangers and other intruders, and can be aggressive with other dogs. Training with plenty of positive reinforcement is a must for this eager-to-please breed.	Besides occasional brushing and bathing, the Tosa’s short, dense coat doesn’t require much upkeep. Other regular maintenance includes nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth brushing. This low-energy breed requires some exercise, such as being taken on a daily walk or being allowed to run freely in a fenced yard.	4	7	9	11
203	Toy Fox Terrier	4	2	5	5	3	3	2	2	4	1	3	5	Toy	Terrier	United States	Early 1900s	American Toy Terrier, Amertoy	The Toy Fox Terrier is an athletic, agile, and graceful dog with surprising strength and the stamina to frolic all day. The coat is short and smooth, perfect for caressing.	Smooth Fox Terriers have long been a favorite of farmers and pet owners. American farmers found smaller individuals, or what they called runts, were especially scrappy, as well as handy for catching rodents around the farm. Pet owners found them especially entertaining and handier for having around the house.In the early 1900s these smaller fox terriers were crossed with several toy breeds, including the Toy Manchester Terrier, Chihuahua, and possibly Italian Greyhound. The result was a smaller version of the Smooth Fox Terrier with a few important differences. The fiery temperament was still there, but tempered a bit — just a bit.The smaller dogs were still registered with the UKC as Smooth Fox Terriers, but in 1936 the UKC granted them their own name and breed status. They remained one of the most popular non-AKC companion breeds in the country until 2003, when they entered the AKC show ring for the first time.TFTs are TNT in a small bundle. Feisty and fun-loving, they are curious at heart and will spend hours investigating the yard, your cabinets, and places you never knew existed. They love to play with people and toys, and make excellent companions for careful older children; however, they do not tolerate inconsiderate handling.They can entertain for hours and are also content to snuggle on a warm lap during recess. This is a one-family, even one-person, dog that doesn’t warm to strangers initially. The TFT’s intelligence, energy, and penchant for showing off make it a quick study and impressive trick dog.	Upkeep consists of making sure the Toy Fox Terrier is supplied with toys, playmates, and an appreciative audience. They need the opportunity to exercise their mind and body, but they can do so in a small area. Without sufficient attention, exercise, and training, they can dig and bark.	The Toy Fox Terrier appreciates a warm, soft bed or lap. They do not care to be wet or cold, and should wear a sweater and even protective earmuffs in cold weather. Coat care is wash and wear.	6	8	10	12
204	Toy Manchester Terrier	4	1	4	4	1	2	1	1	1	1	2	5	Toy	Terrier	England	About 1860	English Toy Terrier, Black and Tan Toy Terrier	The Toy Manchester Terrier is a miniature version of the standard Manchester. As such this breed is sleek, racy, and compact. Slightly longer than tall, this dog has a slightly arched topline and a free and effortless gait. The dog has a keen and alert expression, and a smooth and glossy coat.	One of the preeminent dogs of sixteenth century England was the Black and Tan Terrier. The Black and Tan Terrier, a ratter, and the Whippet, a racer, were crossed, and the result was the dog known since about 1860 as the Manchester Terrier. Other breeds have probably been intermingled with the Manchester during its development, most notably the Italian Greyhound. This may account for the breed’s wide size range. An early standard of 1881 described the existence of a toy variety even then. The AKC initially considered the Manchester and Toy Manchester separate but interbreeding breeds. In 1959, they were changed to be two interbreeding varieties of one breed. Cropped ears are not allowed in showing of Toy Manchester Terriers. The breed is also known as the English Toy Terrier.	Although true to its terrier heritage when it comes to scrappiness, the Toy Manchester is among the gentlest and most sensitive of breeds. The dog is playful with its family, yet reserved, sometimes even timid, with strangers. The Toy Manchester Terrier is inquisitive and the dog’s tendency to chase small animals should be kept in mind during outdoor exercise or with other household pets.	The Toy Manchester enjoys a romp outdoors, but it hates the cold. Indoors, this dog appreciates a soft, warm bed. Coat care is minimal, consisting of occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	45	65	20	27
205	Treeing Walker Coonhound	4	4	3	3	5	4	4	1	2	1	3	4	Hound	Scenthound	United States	1800s	\N	Sometimes called “the people’s choice” among coonhounds, the Treeing Walker is a moderately proportioned hound who can hike over rough terrain with good speed and endurance. Their gait is smooth, effortless, and ground-covering, with good reach and drive. Their coat is short, hard, and close—dense enough to provide some protection against weather. They have a clear, ringing bugle voice or a steady clear chop.	In the mid 1800s, Kentucky residents used Virginia Hounds, descendants of English Foxhounds, to track deer and gray fox, but these dogs were unsuccessful tracking the red foxes that began to appear in the region. Cousins John Walker and George Maupin were especially enthusiastic about tracking dogs during this time.  In 1850, Maupin was given a dog that a traveler had spotted in the lead of a pack tracking deer. The traveler stole the dog, later known as Tennessee Lead, and gave him to Maupin. Lead was adept at tracking red foxes and it was he who began the Treeing Walker Coonhound breed. Later, his lines were mixed with dogs from other states, even Europe, with Walker’s sons taking over.By 1900, Walker hounds were well known. Walker hounds tracked scents over ground and checked trees for scent, and then barked in response. Today the Treeing Walker Coonhound is often described as a “trailing hound that trees” rather than a “treeing hound that trails.” Known for their speed on the trail, these dogs are quick to pick up scents. The Treeing Walker Coonhound became a regular AKC breed in 2012.	The Treeing Walker Coonhound is a fairly energetic dog that often loves to hike and use their nose. They have a tendency to become oblivious to calls when they’ve found an interesting scent.  Treeing Walker Coonhounds make excellent companions and members of the household. They are often loving and eager to please and tend get along well with everyone: strangers, dogs, and most other pets. They are not known for their obedience inclination. Their bark can be quite loud.	Treeing Walker Coonhounds need to get outside and stretch their legs, either with a long walk or jog or off-lead run in a safe area. They like to use their nose and enjoy nose work activities or games. The coat is basically wash and wear.	45	65	21	24
206	Vizsla	3	3	4	5	3	4	5	1	3	1	3	4	Sporting	Pointer	Hungary	Middle Ages	Hungarian Vizsla, Magyar Vizsla, Hungarian Pointer, Drotszoru Magyar Vizsla	The Vizsla is lightly built but muscular, giving them speed and endurance. Their gait is light, graceful, smooth, and ground covering. Their short smooth coat is dense, providing some protection from the elements. Their golden rust color is a hallmark of the breed.	The Vizsla’s forebears may have included breeds that the Magyars collected as they swarmed across Europe before settling in Hungary over a thousand years ago. Writings on falconry from the Middle Ages describe dogs of Vizsla type. The Hungarian plains were rich in game, and hunters wanted a fast but close-working dog that could not only point and retrieve but trail mammals over thick ground cover. The breed was unquestionably established by the eighteenth century, having found special favor with barons and warlords of the time.By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the breed had greatly declined in numbers. They were revived through the discovery of about a dozen  remaining dogs. World War II spread the Vizsla through out the world. Hungarians fleeing Russian occupation took their pointing dogs to various other countries, including America, where their handsome appearance and exceptional hunting abilities were soon appreciated. In America, the Viszla quickly gained admirers, and the breed is now regularly seen in the home. They are also sometimes called the Hungarian Vizsla or Hungarian Pointer.	The Viszla is highly energetic. They are often great hiking partners and always on the lookout for interesting scents. They can become frustrated and destructive if not given adequate exercise. Most can be stubborn, some can be timid, and others can be overly excitable. They are often gentle, affectionate, and sensitive, and can be protective. The Vizsla makes a good companion for an active owner who spends a lot of time outdoors.	The Vizsla needs a lot of strenuous exercise every day. They are an active breed that cannot be expected to meet its energy requirements with a short walk or within a small yard. They need to jog or be allowed to run in a large enclosed area. Otherwise, their needs are minimal. Their coat requires little care except an occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	55	90	23	27
207	Weimaraner	5	4	4	3	2	2	2	4	4	1	3	5	Sporting	Pointer	Germany	1800s	Weimaraner Vorstehund	The Weimaraner is built to move with great speed and endurance and combines grace, stamina, and an alert demeanor. They often have fine aristocratic features, with a kind expression. Their gait is smooth and effortless. Their short sleek coat is noted for its unique gray color.	Germany has always been a country rich in wildlife, and German dog breeds have gained the reputation as some of the best in the world. The Weimaraner originated in the nineteenth century in an effort to create the ideal all-around dog that could hunt game of all sizes, including deer and bear. This effort was sponsored by the court of Weimer, and the breed was initially known as the Weimar Pointer. Some of the breed’s early relatives include the Bloodhound, Red Schweisshund, and early pointing breeds.The origin of the Weimaraner’s distinctive gray color is unknown, but it was an early feature of the breed. This breed was strictly overseen by the German Weimaraner Club. Dogs could not be acquired by non-members, and membership was hard to obtain. Only when an American gained entry to the club and was allowed to take two dogs back to America in 1929 did the Weimaraner leave their native land.Early American Weimaraners performed so extraordinarily in obedience competitions that they aroused great interest. As more people were attracted to the breed, they discovered their great worth as a companion. Today, the breed’s beauty and ability to be a wonderful companion has earned them a steady following.	The Weimaraner is bold and rambunctious, sometimes too much so for small children. They love to run and hike and can become frustrated and destructive if not provided with enough physical activity. The Weimaraner may not be good with small pets unless properly socialized with them. They can be stubborn or headstrong but often learn easily. They function best with an active family who enjoys outdoor activities and wants a fun-loving companion. Some have described them as needing much attention.	Daily strenuous exertion is a must for the Weimaraner. They are not a breed for city life unless their family jogs or runs daily. Even then, they need to stretch their legs, run, and explore in a large, safe area. Their coat care is minimal: occasional brushing to remove dead hair.	35	50	17	19
208	Welsh Springer Spaniel	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	4	Sporting	Spaniel	Wales	1600s	\N	The Welsh Springer Spaniel often has a muscular build. They are in no way a breed of exaggeration. They are very slightly longer than tall, compact, and possessing substance without coarseness. Their strides are powerful and ground covering. Their coat is generally flat and straight, dense enough to protect them from water and weather. Their  expression is often soft.	A dog identified as a Welsh Springer Spaniel is mentioned in some of the earliest records of the Laws of Wales dating around 1300. Whether this dog is the forebear of today’s Welsh Springer is in dispute, however. Other evidence indicates the possibility that the Welsh Springer either developed alongside the English Springer or resulted from mixes of English Springers and Clumber Spaniels. Although land spaniels were used in Wales for some time before the Welsh Springer emerged as a recognized breed, the early dogs were probably not a uniform lot.At the first dog shows in England, English and Welsh Springers were shown together as one breed because the only difference at that time was in their color. The Welsh grew in popularity, and the breed came to America in 1906. But this breed failed to gain the support it needed, and by the end of World War II these dogs may have totally disappeared from America. Newly imported dogs and new supporters, arrived and the Welsh Springer Spaniel has since enjoyed a steady, if modest, popularity.	Less exuberant that the English Springer Spaniel, the Welsh Springer Spaniel is often steady and easygoing. They still need plenty of vigorous exercise, however, as they love outdoor activities, such as hiking.  They are often extremely devoted to their family, but they can also be independent in nature. They are reserved with strangers; some may even be timid. A sensitive breed, they require ample socialization.	The Welsh Springer Spaniel needs daily exercise, which can be met with long walks on leash combined with strenuous games in the yard. They especially like outdoor activities and makes a good hiking companion. Their coat needs brushing once or twice weekly and also may need occasional professional grooming.	20	20	15	16
209	Welsh Terrier	3	3	3	3	3	1	1	1	1	4	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	Wales	1700s	\N	This is a square-proportioned, compact, sturdy dog of medium size, capable of running at good speed for distances. Their gait is free and effortless, with good reach and drive. Their coat is double, with a short, soft undercoat for insulation and a hard, dense, wiry outer coat for protection. Their expression and demeanor are oftentimes confident and alert.	One of only two terriers native to Wales, the Welsh Terrier probably descended from the old Black and Tan Rough Terrier that was popular in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By the late 1700s, a distinctive breed—known as Ynysfor—was running with Otterhounds in North Wales. At the same time, a similar dog, the “Old English Broken Haired” Terrier, was popular in northern England. The two breeds were so similar that when they began to be shown, the same dog could compete successfully as either breed, and they were classified together.Eventually, they all became known as Welsh Terriers, regardless of their origin. After all, both breeds had shared similar backgrounds and had been used to hunt otter, fox, and badger. In 1886, the English Kennel Club recognized the breed. From there, some sought to improve the Welsh Terrier by mixing in other breeds and their characteristics. The result was a dog that in some ways resembles a miniature Airedale Terrier. However, they never have attained the popularity that similar small, long-legged terriers have achieved.	The Welsh Terrier although more mild-mannered than many terriers, is still playful and mischievous enough to provide plenty of entertainment and challenges, and they are calm enough to be a well-mannered member of the family. They are often independent, inquisitive, and sensitive, reserved with strangers, and possibly assertive with other dogs and pets. They need daily exercise in a safe area, like a fenced yard. They may be independent or a bit stubborn. They tend to dig and bark.	The Welsh Terrier needs a moderate walk on leash every day or an invigorating play session. Their coat does not shed. Their wiry jacket needs combing two to three times weekly, plus professional grooming every three months.  Clipping softens their coat texture and alters their color.	15	21	10	11
211	Whippet	3	3	3	4	5	4	3	1	3	1	3	4	Hound	Sighthound	England	1700s	\N	The Whippet is among the sleekest of dogs, with a curvaceous, streamlined silhouette, long legs, and a lean physique. The Whippet is the ultimate sprinter, unsurpassed by any other breed in their ability to accelerate to top speed and to twist and turn with unequaled agility. They are similar to a lightweight version of the Greyhound, with an especially supple topline and powerful hindquarters enabling them to execute their double-suspension gallop. They are square or slightly longer than tall. Their gait is low and free-moving. Their expression is often keen and alert.	A medium-sized sighthound, the Whippet stems from Greyhound roots. The Whippet’s progenitors may have come from mixes between small Greyhounds and even smaller dogs, to be used by peasants for tracking rabbits and other small animals in the eighteenth century. Mixing with terriers who were adept at protecting farms from rodents were probably made to increase quickness.It was the advent of the Industrial Revolution, however, that spurred the refinement of the Whippet breed that most recognize today. Masses of rural workers moved to industrialized areas, bringing with them their dogs and a need for entertainment. They found their dogs would readily race toward a waving rag. Rag racing became the sport of coal miners; in fact, the Whippet was dubbed the “poor man’s race horse.” A family’s Whippet was an immense source of pride. As a valued family member, they shared the family rations and often, the children’s beds, and came to be valued as a companion. After the Whippet was officially recognized as a breed in 1888, they began to be appreciated for their aesthetic appeal. The Whippet gained popularity slowly, but their unequaled combination of lithe elegance and gracious companionship gradually created a devoted following. Today the Whippet is the most popular of the sighthounds and a much loved family companion.	Perhaps the most outgoing and amenable of the sighthounds, the Whippet makes an ideal pet for people who want a somewhat quiet family member and devoted companion. The Whippet is often very gentle with children. They are calm indoors but loves to run and play in the yard. They are often very sensitive (both physically and mentally) and need to be treated and handled accordingly.	The Whippet can make a good apartment dog if they are taken for a long walk or run daily. Their grooming needs are minimal. The Whippet must have a warm, soft bed. They are very sensitive to cool weather and dislike and do not tolerate cold weather. Their hair is extremely short and fine, and the Whippet is virtually free of “doggy odor.”	20	40	18	22
212	Wire Fox Terrier	4	3	4	4	1	2	4	1	4	4	3	5	Terrier	Terrier	England	1800s	\N	The Wire Fox Terrier is short backed and square proportioned, but at the same time standing over a lot of ground. They are known for their speed, endurance, and power. The gait while trotting gets most of its propulsion from the rear quarters. The expression, like the attitude, is keen; the carriage is alert and expectant. The coat is dense, wiry, broken, and twisted, almost appearing like coconut matting, with a short, fine undercoat.	The ultimate show dog, the Wire Fox Terrier has its roots as an effective hunting dog. The breed’s forebears were adept at bolting and perhaps dispatching game, especially fox, that had gone to ground.Some speculation exists that the Smooth and Wire Fox Terriers arose from distinct backgrounds, with the Wire descending from the rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier of Wales. The Wire entered the show ring about 15 to 20 years after the Smooth made its debut. The two varieties were interbred extensively at one time, mainly with the objective of improving the Wire variety by decreasing its size, increasing the amount of white on its coat, and imparting a sleeker outline. This objective was met quite early.Wire Fox Terriers became extremely popular in the years following World War II. In 1985, 100 years after the establishment of the American Fox Terrier Club, the AKC divided the Fox Terrier into two separate breeds.	A true “live-wire,” the Wire Fox Terrier is always up for adventure. This breed lives to play, explore, run, hike, and chase. They can be mischievous and independent and may dig and bark. They are usually fairly reserved with strangers. The Wire has a reputation for being somewhat scrappier with other dogs when compared to the Smooth.	The Fox Terrier must have daily exercise. They will do much to exercise themselves given the room, but they benefit from a good walk on leash, a vigorous play session, or an off-lead outing in a safe area. The Wire’s coat needs combing two or three times weekly, plus shaping every three months.	15	19	16	16
213	Wirehaired Pointing Griffon	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	5	Sporting	Pointer	France	1800s	Korhals Griffon, Pointing, Wirehaired Griffon, Griffon D’Arrêt a Poil Dur	This strong breed can do well with any terrain. They are often slightly longer than tall, and of medium build. They functioned as both a retriever and pointer, and their size and build  reflects this. Their gait is efficient with low, catlike strides. Their coat is of medium length, straight and wiry, with a fine, downy, thick undercoat. This combination provides protection in the swampy country in which they originated, as well as insulation from cold and water. Their abundant facial furnishings contribute to their friendly expression.	Unlike the origin of most breeds, the beginnings of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon were deliberate and fairly well documented, starting in the middle 1800s with the Cherville Griffon, who was subsequently mixed with the setter and pointer. It was Edward Korthals of Holland, however, who is credited with promoting and refining the breed. In fact, the Griffon is still known as the Korthals Griffon throughout most of the world.He began his mission in 1874, mixing twenty dogs across seven breeds (griffons, spaniels, water spaniels, German and French pointers, and setter). Korthals traveled extensively in France and popularized his new breed wherever he went, whether it was a field activity, bench show, or business meeting. Through his French connections, this new breed became adopted in France, where they gained a reputation as a deliberate, careful hunter with a good nose. It was in France that the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon breed found a stronghold, causing people to consider them as a French breed despite their Dutch roots.By 1887, the breed type was stable, and a breed standard was published. The first show classes for the breed were offered in 1888 in England, although at that time they were referred to as a Russian Setter or Retriever (apparently any well-furred dog was assumed to be of Siberian origin). In fact, the first Wirehaired Pointing Griffon registered in America was registered as a Russian Setter in 1887.Their popularity grew steadily, only to be halted by the Second World War. Despite their low numbers, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has loyal fans who value their excellent abilities not only as a pointer and retriever but also as a loyal companion.	The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a skilled dog, often pointing and retrieving with a deliberate style. They combine independent action with amenability. They are a loving member of the family, devoted, willing to please, amiable, and even comical. They are generally friendly toward strangers, other dogs, and pets.	The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon needs daily exercise, either in the form of jogging, games, or a run. They may particularly enjoy swimming. Their coat needs combing or brushing once or twice a week, and professional grooming twice a year. Their ears usually need regular cleaning and sometimes removal of hair within the canal in order to avoid ear problems.	50	60	20	24
215	Yorkshire Terrier	4	1	4	3	2	2	3	1	2	4	4	5	Toy	Terrier	England	1800s	\N	The Yorkshire Terrier’s heritage can be seen in their sharp, intelligent expression, confident carriage, and compact body. They a small breed, however, now more noted for their long, silky hair, which is often fine, glossy, and perfectly straight. Their color is a hallmark of this breed, with the blue a dark steel blue and the tan a clear tan.	The Yorkshire Terrier doesn’t look like a product of the working class, nor do they look like a dog who protected the home from rodents, but they were both. In fact, the Yorkshire area of England was known for having fine animals, and it is thought that the Yorkshire Terrier was no accident but rather the result of purposeful mixing between a variety of terriers, probably including the Waterside Terrier, Clydesdale Terrier, Paisley Terrier, rough-coated English Black and Tan Terrier, and perhaps even the Skye Terrier and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.The Waterside Terrier was one of their early relatives; these were small blue-gray dogs with fairly long hair, usually weighing around 10 pounds, brought from Scotland by weavers. Because of their modest roots, the Yorkshire Terrier was initially looked down upon by other wealthier households with dogs. Even the most snobbish could not deny the breed’s obvious beauty, however, and in short order, Yorkshire Terriers were gracing the laps of wealthy mistresses.By 1880, Yorkshire Terriers had come to America, but the breed varied so much in size that there was great confusion around how big a Yorkshire Terrier might be. Many of these early Yorkies weighed between 12 and 14 pounds. By 1900, people on both sides of the Atlantic had decided that the small size was preferable along with a longer coat. Today, the modern Yorkshire Terrier is one of the smaller and most luxuriously coated dog breeds. These traits, along with their terrier heritage, have placed them as a consistent favorite with families.	The Yorkshire Terrier seems oblivious of their small size, ever eager for adventure and sometimes even trouble! They are busy, inquisitive, bold, stubborn, and can be assertive with strange dogs and small pets. Although some tend to bark a lot, they can easily be taught not to do so through training.	Yorkshire Terriers tend to exercise themselves within the home, but they also need to have interaction in the form of games. They appreciate a daily walk outdoors on leash and enjoy the chance to explore a safe area, like a fenced yard. Their long coat needs brushing or combing every day or two.	7	7	8	9
214	Xoloitzcuintli Mexican Hairless	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	2	1	5	Non-sporting	Primitive	Mexico	Ancient times	Mexican Hairless, Tepezcuintli	The Xoloitzcuintli combines grace and strength equally and is moderate in all aspects of their appearance. All three sizes are slightly longer than tall, and they are lean and sturdy with medium build. Their gait is effortless with good reach and drive. Their coated variety has a short, flat coat. The hairless variety has no coat or almost no coat, often with short, coarse hair on the top of their head, their feet, and the last third of their tail. Their skin is tough and protective. Hairless dogs feel warmer to the touch than coated ones, but they have the same body temperature. This warmth may have helped people think they could cure ailments.	Clay statues of dogs resembling today’s Xoloitzcuintli were interred in Mayan, Colima, and Aztec burial sites dating back 3,000 years. These dogs were believed to guide souls through the underworld. Aztec mythology asserted that Xolotl, the Aztec god of lightning and death, made the Xoloitzcuintli (pronounced show-low-eet-SQUINT-lee) from the “bone of life,” imparting physical and spiritual healing power to the dogs. The name combines Xolotl with “itzcuintli,” Aztec for “dog.”These dogs were found throughout Mexico and parts of Central and South America safeguarding against spirits and intruders and healing people. The hairless dogs were first described by Columbus in his 1492 journal. After the Spanish Conquest, Xolos (their short name) were almost lost, surviving mostly in remote areas. In 1887, the AKC registered the breed as the Mexican Hairless, but their numbers remained low and they were dropped from the ranks in 1959—the only breed ever dropped from the roster. Meanwhile, in 1953, several British and Mexican dog authorities, realizing the breed’s tenuous existence, searched remote Mexico and returned with ten Xoloitzcuintli. In 1956, the breed was named the official dog of Mexico. From there, this breed started to become more well known.In 2007, the Xoloitzcuintli was again recognized and they can be found in three different sizes: Standard, Miniature, and Toy. The gene that causes hairlessness in the Xoloitzcuintli is the same as that in Chinese Cresteds, and the Xoloitzcuintli may descend from ancient Asian hairless dogs. It is a single dominant gene, so all hairless Xoloitzcuintli have one hairless gene and one coated gene. The same gene causes some dental anomalies. About one third of Xoloitzcuintli have coats.	As a primitive breed, Xoloitzcuintli may be somewhat independent natured. They do like to please, but they’re also independent thinkers. They tend to be calm but inquisitive, devoted but not fawning, self-assured but not overly trusting of strangers. They get along fairly well with other dogs and pets. They are alert watchdogs in the home and will alert their family to visitors or strangers, however they are typically not excessive barkers. Some can be escape artists.	All Xoloitzcuintli need daily exercise. They typically will need a long walk or jog. A coated Xoloitzcuintli needs occasional brushing. A hairless Xoloitzcuintli needs no brushing but does need their skin to be wiped or bathed frequently to prevent acne or blackheads, especially when they’re young. They may need a canine sunscreen to protect their skin. Hairless dogs also need a sweater in cool weather. The skin of hairless dogs can be very thick, so it can also be surprisingly tough.	9	35	10	23
